<h2>LOVE WORKS WONDERS.</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A GIRL WITH A CHARACTER.</div>


<p>It was a strange place for an intelligence office, yet Madame
Selini evidently knew what she was doing when she established
her office in an aristocratic neighborhood, and actually next
door to the family mansion of the Countess Dowager of Barewood.
The worthy countess was shocked, and, taking counsel
of her hopes, predicted that Madame Selini's institution would
soon prove a failure. Notwithstanding this prediction, the
agency prospered, and among its patrons were many of the
nobility.</p>

<p>One fine morning in May a carriage stopped before Madame
Selini's door, and from it descended a handsome, aristocratic
gentleman, evidently of the old school. There was some little
commotion in the interior of the building, and then a foot-page<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
appeared to whom Sir Oswald Darrell&mdash;for that was the gentleman's
name&mdash;gave his card.</p>

<p>"I am here by appointment," he said, "to see Madame
Selini."</p>

<p>He was ushered into a handsomely furnished room, where, in
a few minutes, he was joined by Madame Selini herself&mdash;a quick,
bright Frenchwoman, whose dark eyes seemed to embrace
everything in their comprehensive glance. Sir Oswald bowed
with stately courtesy and quaint, old-fashioned grace.</p>

<p>"Have you been so fortunate, madame, as to find that which
I am in search of?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I think you will be pleased, Sir Oswald&mdash;nay, I am sure
you will," answered the lady. "I have a lady waiting to see
you now, who will prove, I should say, a treasure."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald bowed, and madame continued:</p>

<p>"Miss Hastings&mdash;Miss Agnes Hastings&mdash;has been for the last
six years finishing governess at Lady Castledine's, and her two
pupils make their debut this year; so that there is no longer any
occasion for her services."</p>

<p>"And you think she would be fitted, madame, to occupy the
position for which I require a lady of talent and refinement?"</p>

<p>"I am quite sure of it," replied madame. "Miss Hastings
is thirty years of age. She is highly accomplished, and her
manners are exceedingly lady-like. She is a person of great refinement;
moreover, she has had great experience with young
girls. I do not think, Sir Oswald, that you could do better."</p>

<p>"Is the lady here? Can I see her?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Selini rang, and desired the little page to ask Miss
Hastings to come to her. In a few minutes an elegant, well-dressed
lady entered the room. She advanced with a quiet grace
and dignity that seemed natural to her; there was not the
slightest trace of awkwardness or <i>mauvaise honte</i> in her manner.</p>

<p>Madame Selini introduced her to Sir Oswald Darrell.</p>

<p>"I will leave you," she said, "to discuss your private arrangements."</p>

<p>Madame quitted the room with gliding, subtle grace, and
then Sir Oswald, in his courtly fashion, placed a chair for Miss
Hastings. He looked at the pale, clear-cut face for a few minutes
in silence, as though he were at a loss what to say, and
then he commenced suddenly:</p>

<p>"I suppose Madame Selini has told you what I want, Miss
Hastings?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the quiet reply; "your niece has been neglected&mdash;you
want some one to take the entire superintendence of
her."</p>

<p>"Neglected!" exclaimed Sir Oswald. "My dear madame,
that is a mild word, which does not express the dreadful reality.
I wish to disguise nothing from you, I assure you&mdash;she literally
horrifies me."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings smiled.</p>

<p>"Neglected!" he repeated&mdash;"the girl is a savage&mdash;a splendid
savage&mdash;nothing more nor less."</p>

<p>"Has she not received any kind of training, then, Sir
Oswald?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Training! My dear madame, can you imagine what a wild
vine is&mdash;a vine that has never been cultivated or pruned, but
allowed to grow wild in all its natural beauty and strength, to
cling where it would, to trail on the ground and to twine round
forest trees? Such a vine is a fit type of my niece."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings looked slightly bewildered. Here was a very
different pupil from the elegant, graceful daughters of Lady
Castledine.</p>

<p>"I should, perhaps," continued Sir Oswald, "explain to you
the peculiar position that my niece, Miss Pauline Darrell, has
occupied."</p>

<p>His grand old face flushed, and his stately head was bowed,
as though some of the memories that swept over him were not
free from shame; and then, with a little gesture of his white
hand, on which shone a large diamond ring, he said:</p>

<p>"There is no need for me to tell you, Miss Hastings, that the
Darrells are one of the oldest families in England&mdash;ancient,
honorable, and, I must confess, proud&mdash;very proud. My
father, the late Sir Hildebert Darrell, was, I should say, one of
the proudest and most reserved of men. He had but two children,
myself and a daughter twelve years younger&mdash;my sister
Felicia. I was educated abroad. It was one of my father's
fancies that I should see many lands, that I should study men
and women before settling down to my right position in the
world; so that I knew but little of my sister Felicia. She was
a child when I left home&mdash;the tragedy of her life had happened
before I returned."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Again a great rush of color came over the pale, aristocratic
face.</p>

<p>"I must apologize, Miss Hastings, for troubling you with
these details, but unless you understand them you will not understand
my niece. I cannot tell you how it happened, but it
did so happen that while I was away my sister disgraced herself;
she left home with a French artist, whom Sir Hildebert had engaged
to renovate some choice and costly pictures at Darrell
Court. How it came about I cannot say&mdash;perhaps there were
excuses for her. She may have found home very dull&mdash;my
father was harsh and cold, and her mother was dead. It may be
that when the young artist told her of warm love in sunny lands
she was tempted, poor child, to leave the paternal roof.</p>

<p>"My father's wrath was terrible; he pursued Julian L'Estrange
with unrelenting fury. I believe the man would have been a
successful artist but for my father, who had vowed to ruin him,
and who never rested until he had done so&mdash;until he had reduced
him to direst poverty&mdash;and then my sister appealed for
help, and my father refused to grant it. He would not allow
her name to be mentioned among us; her portrait was destroyed;
everything belonging to her was sent away from Darrell
Court.</p>

<p>"When I returned&mdash;in an interview that I shall never forget&mdash;my
father threatened me not only with disinheritance, but with
his curse, if I made any attempt to hold the least communication
with my sister. I do not know that I should have obeyed
him if I could have found her, but I did not even know what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
part of the world she was in. She died, poor girl, and I have
no doubt that her death was greatly hastened by privation. My
father told me of her death, also that she had left one daughter;
he did more&mdash;he wrote to Julian L'Estrange, and offered to
adopt his daughter on the one condition that he would consent
never to see her or hold the least communication with her.</p>

<p>"The reply was, as you may imagine, a firm refusal and a
fierce denunciation. In the same letter came a note, written in
a large, childish hand:</p>

<p>"'I love my papa, and I do not love you. I will not come
to live with you. You are a cruel man, and you helped to kill
my dear mamma.'</p>

<p>"It was a characteristic little note, and was signed 'Pauline
L'Estrange.' My father's anger on receiving it was very great.
I confess that I was more amused than angry.</p>

<p>"My father, Miss Hastings, lived to a good old age. I was
not a young man when I succeeded him. He left me all his
property. You must understand the Darrell and Audleigh
Royal estates are not entailed. He made no mention in his
will of the only grandchild he had; but, after I had arranged all
my affairs, I resolved to find her. For ten years I have been
doing all I could&mdash;sending to France, Italy, Spain, and every
country where I thought it possible the artist might have sought
refuge.</p>

<p>"Three months since I received a letter from him, written on
his death-bed, asking me to do something for Pauline, who had
grown up into a beautiful girl of seventeen. I found then that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
he had been living for some years in the Rue d'Orme, Paris. I
buried him, brought his daughter to England, and made
arrangements whereby she should assume the name of Darrell.
But I little knew what a task I had undertaken. Pauline ought
to be my heiress, Miss Hastings. She ought to succeed me at
Darrell Court. I have no other relatives. But&mdash;well, I will
not despair; you will see what can be done with her."</p>

<p>"What are her deficiencies?" asked Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald raised his white hands with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>"I will tell you briefly. She has lived among artists. She
does not seem to have ever known any of her own sex. She is&mdash;I
am sorry to use the word&mdash;a perfect Bohemian. Whether
she can be transformed into anything faintly resembling a lady,
I cannot tell. Will you undertake the task, Miss Hastings?"</p>

<p>She looked very thoughtful for some minutes, and then
answered:</p>

<p>"I will do my best, Sir Oswald."</p>

<p>"I thank you very much. You must permit me to name
liberal terms, for your task will be no light one."</p>

<p>And the interview ended, to their mutual satisfaction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"DARRELL COURT IS A PRISON TO ME!"</div>


<p>It was a beautiful May day, bright with fresh spring loveliness.
The leaves were springing fresh and green from the trees; the
hedges were all abloom with pink hawthorn; the chestnut trees
were all in flower; the gold of the laburnum, the purple of the
lilac, the white of the fair acacia trees, and the delicate green of
the stately elms and limes gave a beautiful variety of color.
The grass was dotted with a hundred wild-flowers; great clusters
of yellow buttercups looked in the distance like the upspreading
of a sea of gold; the violets perfumed the air, the bluebells
stirred in the sweet spring breeze, and the birds sang out loudly
and jubilantly.</p>

<p>If one spot looked more lovely than another on this bright
May day, it was Darrell Court, for it stood where the sun shone
brightest, in one of the most romantic and picturesque nooks of
England&mdash;the part of Woodshire bordering on the sea.</p>

<p>The mansion and estates stood on gently rising ground; a
chain of purple hills stretched away into the far distance; then
came the pretty town of Audleigh Royal, the Audleigh Woods,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and the broad, deep river Darte. The bank of the river formed
the boundary of the Darrell estates, a rich and magnificent
heritage, wherein every beauty of meadow and wood seemed to
meet. The park was rich in its stately trees and herds of deer;
and not far from the house was a fir-wood&mdash;an aromatic, odorous
fir-wood, which led to the very shores of the smiling southern
sea.</p>

<p>By night and by day the grand music of nature was heard in
perfection at Darrell Court. Sometimes it was the roll of the
wind across the hills, or the beat of angry waves on the shore,
or the wild melody of the storm among the pine trees, or the
full chorus of a thousand feathered songsters. The court itself
was one of the most picturesque of mansions. It did not
belong to any one order or style of architecture&mdash;there was nothing
stiff or formal about it&mdash;but it looked in that bright May
sunshine a noble edifice, with its square towers covered with
clinging ivy, gray turrets, and large arched windows.</p>

<p>Did the sun ever shine upon such a combination of colors?
The spray of the fountains glittered in the air, the numerous
balconies were filled with flowers; wherever it was possible for a
flower to take root, one had been placed to grow&mdash;purple wistarias,
sad, solemn passion-flowers, roses of every hue. The star-like
jessamine and scarlet creepers gave to the walls of the old
mansion a vivid glow of color; gold and purple enriched the
gardens, heavy white lilies breathed faintest perfume. The spot
looked a very Eden.</p>

<p>The grand front entrance consisted of a large gothic porch,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
which was reached by a broad flight of steps, adorned with
white marble vases filled with flowers; the first terrace was immediately
below, and terrace led from terrace down to the grand
old gardens, where sweetest blossoms grew.</p>

<p>There was an old-world air about the place&mdash;something patrician,
quiet, reserved. It was no vulgar haunt for vulgar crowds;
it was not a show place; and the master of it, Sir Oswald Darrell,
as he stood upon the terrace, looked in keeping with the
surroundings.</p>

<p>There was a <i>distingue</i> air about Sir Oswald, an old-fashioned
courtly dignity, which never for one moment left him. He was
thoroughly well bred; he had not two sets of manners&mdash;one for
the world, and one for private life; he was always the same,
measured in speech, noble in his grave condescension. No
man ever more thoroughly deserved the name of aristocrat; he
was delicate and fastidious, with profound and deeply-rooted dislike
for all that was ill-bred, vulgar, or mean.</p>

<p>Even in his dress Sir Oswald was remarkable; the superfine
white linen, the diamond studs and sleeve links, the rare jewels
that gleamed on his fingers&mdash;all struck the attention; and, as he
took from his pocket a richly engraved golden snuff-box and
tapped it with the ends of his delicate white fingers, there stood
revealed a thorough aristocrat&mdash;the ideal of an English patrician
gentleman.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald walked round the stately terraces and gardens.</p>

<p>"I do not see her," he said to himself; "yet most certainly
Frampton told me she was here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, with his gold-headed cane in hand, Sir Oswald descended
to the gardens. He was evidently in search of some
one. Meeting one of the gardeners, who stood, hat in hand,
as he passed by, Sir Oswald asked:</p>

<p>"Have you seen Miss Darrell in the gardens?"</p>

<p>"I saw Miss Darrell in the fernery some five minutes since,
Sir Oswald," was the reply.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald drew from his pocket a very fine white handkerchief
and diffused an agreeable odor of millefleurs around him;
the gardener had been near the stables, and Sir Oswald was
fastidious.</p>

<p>A short walk brought him to the fernery, an exquisite combination
of rock and rustic work, arched by a dainty green roof,
and made musical by the ripple of a little waterfall. Sir Oswald
looked in cautiously, evidently rather in dread of what he might
find there; then his eyes fell upon something, and he said:</p>

<p>"Pauline, are you there?"</p>

<p>A rich, clear, musical voice answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, I am here, uncle."</p>

<p>"My dear," continued Sir Oswald, half timidly, not advancing
a step farther into the grotto, "may I ask what you are
doing?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, uncle," was the cheerful reply; "you may ask
by all means. The difficulty is to answer; for I am really doing
nothing, and I do not know how to describe 'nothing.'"</p>

<p>"Why did you come hither?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To dream," replied the musical voice. "I think the sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of falling water is the sweetest music in the world. I came here
to enjoy it, and to dream over it."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald looked very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Considering, Pauline, how much you have been neglected,
do you not think you might spend your time more profitably&mdash;in
educating yourself, for example?"</p>

<p>"This is educating myself. I am teaching myself beautiful
thoughts, and nature just now is my singing mistress." And
then the speaker's voice suddenly changed, and a ring of
passion came into it. "Who says that I have been neglected?
When you say that, you speak ill of my dear dead father, and
no one shall do that in my presence. You speak slander, and
slander ill becomes an English gentleman. If I was neglected
when my father was alive, I wish to goodness such neglect were
my portion now!"</p>

<p>Sir Oswald shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Each one to his or her taste, Pauline. With very little
more of such neglect you would have been a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused; perhaps some instinct of prudence warned him.</p>

<p>"A what?" she demanded, scornfully. "Pray finish the
sentence, Sir Oswald."</p>

<p>"My dear, you are too impulsive, too hasty. You want
more quietness of manner, more dignity."</p>

<p>Her voice deepened in its tones as she asked:</p>

<p>"I should have been a what, Sir Oswald? I never begin a
sentence and leave it half finished. You surely are not afraid
to finish it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, my dear," was the calm reply; "there never yet was a
Darrell afraid of anything on earth. If you particularly wish
me to do so, I will finish what I was about to say. You would
have been a confirmed Bohemian, and nothing could have made
you a lady."</p>

<p>"I love what you call Bohemians, and I detest what you call
ladies, Sir Oswald," was the angry retort.</p>

<p>"Most probably; but then, you see, Pauline, the ladies of
the house of Darrell have always been ladies&mdash;high-bred, elegant
women. I doubt if any of them ever knew what the word
'Bohemian' meant."</p>

<p>She laughed a little scornful laugh, which yet was sweet and
clear as the sound of silver bells.</p>

<p>"I had almost forgotten," said Sir Oswald. "I came to
speak to you about something, Pauline; will you come into the
house with me?"</p>

<p>They walked on together in silence for some minutes, and
then Sir Oswald began:</p>

<p>"I went to London, as you know, last week, Pauline, and
my errand was on your behalf."</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows, but did not deign to ask any questions.</p>

<p>"I have engaged a lady to live with us here at Darrell Court,
whose duties will be to finish your education, or, rather, I may
truthfully say, to begin it, to train you in the habits of refined
society, to&mdash;to&mdash;make you presentable, in fact, Pauline, which
I am sorry, really sorry to say, you are not at present."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>She made him a low bow&mdash;a bow full of defiance and rebellion.</p>

<p>"I am indeed indebted to you, Sir Oswald."</p>

<p>"No trifling," said the stately baronet, "no sarcasm, Pauline,
but listen to me! You are not without sense or reason&mdash;pray
attend. Look around you," he continued; "remember that
the broad fair lands of Darrell Court form one of the grandest
domains in England. It is an inheritance almost royal in its
extent and magnificence. Whoso reigns here is king or queen
of half a county, is looked up to, respected, honored, admired,
and imitated. The owner of Darrell Court is a power even in
this powerful land of ours; men and women look up to such a
one for guidance and example. Judge then what the owner of
the inheritance should be."</p>

<p>The baronet's grand old face was flushed with emotion.</p>

<p>"He must be pure, or he would make immorality the
fashion; honorable, because men will take their notions of
honor from him; just, that justice may abound; upright, stainless.
You see all that, Pauline?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she assented, quickly.</p>

<p>"No men have so much to answer for," continued Sir Oswald,
"as the great ones of the land&mdash;men in whose hands power is
vested&mdash;men to whom others look for example, on whose lives
other lives are modeled&mdash;men who, as it were, carry the minds,
if not the souls, of their fellow men in the hollows of their
hands."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Pauline looked more impressed, and insensibly drew nearer
to him.</p>

<p>"Such men, I thank Heaven," he said, standing bareheaded
as he uttered the words, "have the Darrells been&mdash;loyal, upright,
honest, honorable, of stainless repute, of stainless life,
fitted to rule their fellow men&mdash;grand men, sprung from a grand
old race. And at times women have reigned here&mdash;women
whose names have lived in the annals of the land&mdash;who have
been as shining lights from the purity, the refinement, the
grandeur of their lives."</p>

<p>He spoke with a passion of eloquence not lost on the girl by
his side.</p>

<p>"I," he continued, humbly, "am one of the least worthy of
my race. I have done nothing for its advancement; but at the
same time I have done nothing to disgrace it. I have carried
on the honors passively. The time is coming when Darrell
Court must pass into other hands. Now, Pauline, you have
heard, you know what the ruler of Darrell Court should be.
Tell me, are you fitted to take your place here?"</p>

<p>"I am very young," she murmured.</p>

<p>"It is not a question of youth. Dame Sibella Darrell reigned
here when she was only eighteen; and the sons she trained to
succeed her were among the greatest statesmen England has ever
known. She improved and enlarged the property; she died,
after living here sixty years, beloved, honored, and revered. It
is not a question of age."</p>

<p>"I am a Darrell!" said the girl, proudly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you have the face and figure of a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Darrel'">Darrell</ins>; you bear the
name, too; but you have not the grace and manner of a
Darrell."</p>

<p>"Those are mere outward matters of polish and veneer," she
said, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Nay, not so. You would not think it right to see an unformed,
untrained, uneducated, ignorant girl at the head of such
a house as this. What did you do yesterday? A maid displeased
you. You boxed her ears. Just imagine it. Such a
proceeding on the part of the mistress of Darrell Court would
fill one with horror."</p>

<p>A slight smile rippled over the full crimson lips.</p>

<p>"Queen Elizabeth boxed her courtiers' ears," said the girl,
"and it seemed right to her."</p>

<p>"A queen, Pauline, is hedged in by her own royalty; she
may do what she will. The very fact that you are capable of
defending an action so violent, so unlady-like, so opposed to all
one's ideas of feminine delicacy, proves that you are unfit for the
position you ought to occupy."</p>

<p>"I am honest, at least. I make no pretensions to be what I
am not."</p>

<p>"So is my butler honest, but that does not fit him to be master
of Darrell Court. Honesty is but one quality&mdash;a good one,
sturdy and strong; it requires not one, but many qualities to
hold such a position as I would fain have you occupy."</p>

<p>Miss Darrell's patience was evidently at an end.</p>

<p>"And the upshot of all this, Sir Oswald, is&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Exactly so&mdash;that I am anxious to give you every chance in
my power&mdash;that I have found an estimable, refined, elegant
woman, who will devote her time and talents to train you and fit
you for society."</p>

<p>A low, musical laugh broke from the perfect lips.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea," she asked, "what I shall be like when
I am trained?"</p>

<p>"Like a lady, I trust&mdash;a well-bred lady. I can imagine
nothing more beautiful than that."</p>

<p>"When is she coming, this model of yours, Sir Oswald?"</p>

<p>"Nay, your model, niece, not mine. She is here now, and
I wish to introduce her to you. I should like you, if possible,"
he concluded, meekly, "to make a favorable impression on
her."</p>

<p>There was another impatient murmur.</p>

<p>"I wish you to understand, Pauline," he resumed, after a
short pause, "that I shall expect you to render the most implicit
obedience to Miss Hastings&mdash;to follow whatever rules she may
lay down for you, to attend to your studies as she directs them,
to pay the greatest heed to all her corrections, to copy her style,
to imitate her manners, to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hate her!" was the impetuous outburst. "I would
sooner be a beggar all my life than submit to such restraint."</p>

<p>"Very well," returned Sir Oswald, calmly. "I know that
arguing with you is time lost. The choice lies with yourself. If
you decide to do as I wish&mdash;to study to become a lady in the
truest sense of the word&mdash;if you will fit yourself for the position,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
you shall be heiress of Darrell Court; if not&mdash;if you persist in
your present unlady-like, unrefined, Bohemian manner, I shall
leave the whole property to some one else. I tell you the plain
truth without any disguise."</p>

<p>"I do not want Darrell Court!" she cried, passionately; "it
is a prison to me!"</p>

<p>"I excuse you," rejoined Sir Oswald, coldly; "you are excited,
and so not answerable for what you say."</p>

<p>"Uncle," said the girl, "do you see that beautiful singing
bird there, giving voice to such glorious melody? Do you think
you could catch it and put it in a cage?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that I could," replied Sir Oswald.</p>

<p>"But, if you did," she persisted; "even suppose you could
make it forget its own wild melodies, could you teach it to sing
formally by note and at your will?"</p>

<p>"I have never supposed anything of the kind," said Sir
Oswald. "You are possessed of far too much of that kind of
nonsense. The young ladies of the present day&mdash;properly educated
girls&mdash;do not talk in that way."</p>

<p>"I can easily believe it," she returned, bitterly.</p>

<p>"Miss Hastings is in the library," said Sir Oswald, as they
entered the house. "I hope to see you receive her kindly.
Put away that frown, Pauline, and smile if you can. Remember,
it is characteristic of the Darrells to be gracious to
strangers."</p>

<p>With these words Sir Oswald opened the library door, and
holding his niece's hand, entered the room. Miss Hastings rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to receive them. He led Pauline to her, and in the kindest
manner possible introduced them to each other.</p>

<p>"I will leave you together," he said. "Pauline will show
you your rooms, Miss Hastings; and I hope that you will soon
feel happy, and quite at home with us."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald quitted the library, leaving the two ladies looking
in silence at each other.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"YOUR GOOD SOCIETY IS ALL DECEIT."</div>


<p>Miss Hastings had been prepared to see a hoiden, an awkward,
unfledged schoolgirl, one who, never having seen much
of good society, had none of the little graces and charms that
distinguish young ladies. She had expected to see a tall, gaunt
girl, with red hands, and a general air of not knowing what to
do with herself&mdash;that was the idea she had formed. She gazed
in wonder at the reality&mdash;a magnificent figure&mdash;a girl whose
grand, pale, statuesque beauty was something that could never
be forgotten. There was nothing of the boarding-school young
lady about her; no acquired graces. She was simply magnificent&mdash;no
other word could describe her. Miss Hastings, as she
looked at her, thought involuntarily of the graceful lines, the
beautiful curves, the grand, free grace of the world-renowned
Diana of the Louvre; there was the same arched, graceful neck,
the same royal symmetry, the same harmony of outline.</p>

<p>In one of the most celebrated art galleries of Rome Miss
Hastings remembered to have seen a superb bust of Juno; as
she looked at her new pupil, she could almost fancy that its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
head had been modeled from hers. Pauline's head was royal in
its queenly contour; the brow low, white, and rounded at the
temples; the hair, waving in lines of inexpressible beauty, was
loosely gathered together and fastened behind with a gleaming
silver arrow. The eyes were perhaps the most wonderful feature
in that wonderful face; they were dark as night itself, somewhat
in hue like a purple heartsease, rich, soft, dreamy, yet at times
all fire, all brightness, filled with passion more intense than any
words, and shining then with a strange half-golden light. The
brows were straight, dark, and beautiful; the lips crimson, full,
and exquisitely shaped; the mouth looked like one that could
persuade or contemn&mdash;that could express tenderness or scorn,
love or pride, with the slightest play of the lips.</p>

<p>Every attitude the girl assumed was full of unconscious grace.
She did not appear to be in the least conscious of her wonderful
beauty. She had walked to the window, and stood leaning
carelessly against the frame, one beautiful arm thrown above her
head, as though she were weary, and would fain rest&mdash;an attitude
that could not have been surpassed had she studied it for
years.</p>

<p>"You are not at all what I expected to see," said Miss Hastings,
at last. "You are, indeed, so different that I am taken
by surprise."</p>

<p>"Am I better or worse than you had imagined me?" she
asked, with careless scorn.</p>

<p>"You are different&mdash;better, perhaps, in some things. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
are taller. You are so tall that it will be difficult to remember
you are a pupil."</p>

<p>"The Darrells are a tall race," she said, quietly. "Miss
Hastings, what have you come here to teach me?"</p>

<p>The elder lady rose from her seat and looked lovingly into the
face of the girl; she placed her hand caressingly on the slender
shoulders.</p>

<p>"I know what I should like to teach you, Miss Darrell, if
you will let me. I should like to teach you your duty to
Heaven, your fellow-creatures, and yourself."</p>

<p>"That would be dry learning, I fear," she returned. "What
does my uncle wish me to learn?"</p>

<p>"To be in all respects a perfectly refined, graceful lady."</p>

<p>Her face flushed with a great crimson wave that rose to the
white brow and the delicate shell-like ears.</p>

<p>"I shall never be that," she cried, passionately. "I may just
as well give up all hopes of Darrell Court. I have seen some
ladies since I have been here. I could not be like them. They
seem to speak by rule; they all say the same kind of things,
with the same smiles, in the same tone of voice; they follow
each other like sheep; they seem frightened to advance an
opinion of their own, or even give utterance to an original
thought. They look upon me as something horrible, because I
dare to say what I think, and have read every book I could
find."</p>

<p>"It is not always best to put our thoughts in speech; and
the chances are, Miss Darrell, that, if you have read every book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
you could find, you have read many that would have been better
left alone. You are giving a very one-sided, prejudiced view
after all."</p>

<p>She raised her beautiful head with a gesture of superb disdain.</p>

<p>"There is the same difference between them and myself as
between a mechanical singing bird made to sing three tunes and
a wild, sweet bird of the woods. I like my own self best."</p>

<p>"There is not the least doubt of that," observed Miss Hastings,
with a smile; "but the question is not so much what we
like ourselves as what others like in us. However, we will discuss
that at another time, Miss Darrell."</p>

<p>"Has my uncle told you that if I please him&mdash;if I can be
molded into the right form&mdash;I am to be heiress of Darrell
Court?" she asked, quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes; and now that I have seen you I am persuaded that
you can be anything you wish."</p>

<p>"Do you think, then, that I am clever?" she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I should imagine so," replied Miss Hastings. "Pauline&mdash;I
need not call you Miss Darrell&mdash;I hope we shall be friends; I
trust we shall be happy together."</p>

<p>"It is not very likely," she said, slowly, "that I can like you,
Miss Hastings."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the governess, astonished at her frankness.</p>

<p>"Because you are to correct me; continual correction will be
a great annoyance, and will prevent my really liking you."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings looked astounded.</p>

<p>"That may be, Pauline," she said; "but do you know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
it is not polite of you to say so? In good society one does not
tell such unpleasant truths."</p>

<p>"That is just it," was the eager retort; "that is why I do not
like good society, and shall never be fit for it. I am truthful by
nature. In my father's house and among his friends there was
never any need to conceal the truth; we always spoke it frankly.
If we did not like each other, we said so. But here, it seems
to me, the first lesson learned to fit one for society is to speak
falsely."</p>

<p>"Not so, Pauline; but, when the truth is likely to hurt another's
feelings, to wound susceptibility or pride, why speak it,
unless it is called for?"</p>

<p>Pauline moved her white arms with a superb gesture of scorn.</p>

<p>"I would rather any day hear the truth and have my mind
hurt," she said, energetically, "than feel that people were
smiling at me and deceiving me. Lady Hampton visits Sir
Oswald. I do not like her, and she does not like me; but she
always asks Sir Oswald how his 'dear niece' is, and she calls me
a 'sweet creature&mdash;original, but very sweet' You can see for
yourself, Miss Hastings, that I am not that."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you are not sweet," returned the governess, smiling;
"but, Pauline, you are a mimic, and mimicry is a dangerous
gift."</p>

<p>She had imitated Lady Hampton's languid tones and affected
accent to perfection.</p>

<p>"Sir Oswald bows and smiles all the time Lady Hampton is
talking to him; he stands first upon one foot, and then upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the other. You would think, to listen to him, that he was so
charmed with her ladyship that he could not exist out of her
presence. Yet I have seen him quite delighted at her departure,
and twice I heard him say 'Thank Heaven'&mdash;it was for the
relief. Your good society is all deceit, Miss Hastings."</p>

<p>"I will not have you say that, Pauline. Amiability, and the
desire always to be kind and considerate, may carry one to extremes
at times; but I am inclined to prefer the amiability that
spares to the truth that wounds."</p>

<p>"I am not," was the blunt rejoinder. "Will you come to
your rooms, Miss Hastings? Sir Oswald has ordered a suite to
be prepared entirely for our use. I have three rooms, you have
four; and there is a study that we can use together."</p>

<p>They went through the broad stately corridors, where the warm
sun shone in at the windows, and the flowers breathed sweetest
perfume. The rooms that had been prepared for them were
bright and pleasant with a beautiful view from the windows, well
furnished, and supplied with every comfort. A sigh came from
Miss Hastings as she gazed&mdash;it was all so pleasant. But it
seemed very doubtful to her whether she would remain or not&mdash;very
doubtful whether she would be able to make what Sir Oswald
desired out of that frank, free-spoken girl, who had not
one conventional idea.</p>

<p>"Sir Oswald is very kind," she said, at length, looking around
her; "these rooms are exceedingly nice."</p>

<p>"They are nice," said Pauline; "but I was happier with my
father in the Rue d'Orme. Ah me, what liberty we had there!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
In this stately life I feel as though I were bound with cords, or
shackled with chains&mdash;as though I longed to stretch out my
arms and fly away."</p>

<p>Again Miss Hastings sighed, for it seemed to her that the
time of her residence at Darrell Court would in all probability
be very short.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"YOU ARE GOING TO SPOIL MY LIFE."</div>


<p>Two days had passed since Miss Hastings' arrival. On a
beautiful morning, when the sun was shining and the birds were
singing in the trees, she sat in the study, with an expression of
deepest anxiety, of deepest thought on her face. Pauline, with
a smile on her lips, sat opposite to her, and there was profound
silence. Miss Darrell was the first to break it.</p>

<p>"Well," she asked, laughingly, "what is your verdict, Miss
Hastings?"</p>

<p>The elder lady looked up with a long, deep-drawn sigh.</p>

<p>"I have never been so completely puzzled in all my life," she
replied. "My dear Pauline, you are the strangest mixture of
ignorance and knowledge that I have ever met. You know a
great deal, but it is all of the wrong kind; you ought to unlearn
all that you have learned."</p>

<p>"You admit then that I know something."</p>

<p>"Yes; but it would be almost better, perhaps, if you did not.
I will tell you how I feel, Pauline. I know nothing of building,
but I feel as though I had been placed before a heap of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
marble, porphyry, and granite, of wood, glass, and iron, and
then told from those materials to shape a magnificent palace. I
am at a loss what to do."</p>

<p>Miss Darrell laughed with the glee of a child. Her governess,
repressing her surprise, continued:</p>

<p>"You know more in some respects than most educated
women; in other and equally essential matters you know less
than a child. You speak French fluently, perfectly; you have
read a large number of books in the French language&mdash;good,
bad, and indifferent, it appears to me; yet you have no more
idea of French grammar or of the idiom or construction of the
language than a child."</p>

<p>"That, indeed, I have not; I consider grammar the most
stupid of all human inventions."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings offered no comment.</p>

<p>"Again," she continued, "you speak good English, but your
spelling is bad, and your writing worse. You are better
acquainted with English literature than I am&mdash;that is, you have
read more. You have read indiscriminately; even the titles of
some of the books you have read are not admissible."</p>

<p>The dark eyes flashed, and the pale, grand face was stirred as
though by some sudden emotion.</p>

<p>"There was a large library in the house where we lived," she
explained, hurriedly, "and I read every book in it. I read
from early morning until late at night, and sometimes from night
until morning; there was no one to tell me what was right and
what was wrong, Miss Hastings."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then," continued the governess, "you have written a
spirited poem on Anne Boleyn, but you know nothing of English
history&mdash;neither the dates nor the incidents of a single reign.
You have written the half of a story, the scene of which is laid
in the tropics, yet of geography you have not the faintest notion.
Of matters such as every girl has some idea of&mdash;of biography,
of botany, of astronomy&mdash;you have not even a glimmer. The
chances are, that if you engaged in conversation with any sensible
person, you would equally astonish, first by the clever things
you would utter, and then by the utter ignorance you would
display."</p>

<p>"I cannot be flattered, Miss Hastings," Pauline put in, "because
you humiliate me; nor can I be humiliated, because you
flatter me."</p>

<p>But Miss Hastings pursued her criticisms steadily.</p>

<p>"You have not the slightest knowledge of arithmetic. As
for knowledge of a higher class, you have none. You are dreadfully
deficient. You say that you have read Auguste Comte,
but you do not know the answer to the first question in your
church catechism. Your education requires beginning all over
again. You have never had any settled plan of study, I should
imagine."</p>

<p>"No. I learned drawing from Jules Lacroix. Talk of
talent, Miss Hastings. You should have known him&mdash;he was
the handsomest artist I ever saw. There was something so picturesque
about him."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," was the dry response; "but I think 'picturesque'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
is not the word to use in such a case. Music, I presume,
you <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thought'">taught</ins> yourself?"</p>

<p>The girl's whole face brightened&mdash;her manner changed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I taught myself; poor papa could not afford to pay for
my lessons. Shall I play to you, Miss Hastings?"</p>

<p>There was a piano in the study, a beautiful and valuable instrument,
which Sir Oswald had ordered for his niece.</p>

<p>"I shall be much pleased to hear you," said Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>Pauline Darrell rose and went to the piano. Her face then
was as the face of one inspired. She sat down and played a few
chords, full, beautiful, and harmonious.</p>

<p>"I will sing to you," she said. "We often went to the opera&mdash;papa,
Jules, Louis, and myself. I used to sing everything I
heard. This is from 'Il Puritani.'"</p>

<p>And she sang one of the most beautiful solos in the opera.</p>

<p>Her voice was magnificent, full, ringing, vibrating with
passion&mdash;a voice that, like her face, could hardly be forgotten;
but she played and sang entirely after a fashion of her own.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Hastings," she said, "I will imitate Adelina
Patti."</p>

<p>Face, voice, manner, all changed; she began one of the far-famed
prima-donna's most admired songs, and Miss Hastings
owned to herself that if she had closed her eyes she might have
believed Madame Patti present.</p>

<p>"This is <i>a la</i> Christine Nilsson," continued Pauline; and
again the imitation was brilliant and perfect.</p>

<p>The magnificent voice did not seem to tire, though she sang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
song after song, and imitated in the most marvelous manner
some of the grandest singers of the day. Miss Hasting left her
seat and went up to her.</p>

<p>"You have a splendid voice, my dear, and great musical
genius. Now tell me, do you know a single note of music?"</p>

<p>"Not one," was the quick reply.</p>

<p>"You know nothing of the keys, time, or anything else?"</p>

<p>"Why should I trouble myself when I could play without
learning anything of the kind?"</p>

<p>"But that kind of playing, Pauline, although it is very clever,
would not do for educated people."</p>

<p>"Is it not good enough for them?" she asked, serenely.</p>

<p>"No; one cannot help admiring it, but any educated person
hearing you would detect directly that you did not know your
notes."</p>

<p>"Would they think much less of me on that account?" she
asked, with the same serenity.</p>

<p>"Yes; every one would think it sad to see so much talent
wasted. You must begin to study hard; you must learn to play
by note, not by ear, and then all will be well. You love music,
Pauline?"</p>

<p>How the beautiful face glowed and the dark eyes shone.</p>

<p>"I love it," she said, "because I can put my whole soul into
it&mdash;there is room for one's soul in it. You will be shocked, I
know, but that is why I liked Comte's theories&mdash;because they
filled my mind, and gave me so much to think of."</p>

<p>"Were I in your place I should try to forget them, Pauline."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"You should have seen Sir Oswald's face when I told him I
had read Comte and Darwin. He positively groaned aloud."</p>

<p>And she laughed as she remembered his misery.</p>

<p>"I feel very much inclined to groan myself," said Miss Hastings.
"You shall have theories, or facts, higher, more beautiful,
nobler, grander far than any Comte ever dreamed. And
now we must begin to work in real earnest."</p>

<p>But Pauline Darrell did not move; her dark eyes were shadowed,
her beautiful face grew sullen and determined.</p>

<p>"You are going to spoil my life," she said. "Hitherto it
has been a glorious life&mdash;free, gladsome, and bright; now you
are going to parcel it out. There will be no more sunshiny
hours; you are going to reduce me to a kind of machine, to cut
off all my beautiful dreams, my lofty thoughts. You want to
make me a formal, precise young lady, who will laugh, speak,
and think by rule."</p>

<p>"I want to make you a sensible woman, my dear Pauline,"
corrected Miss Hastings, gravely.</p>

<p>"Who is the better or the happier for being so sensible?"
demanded Pauline.</p>

<p>She paused for a few minutes, and then she added, suddenly:</p>

<p>"Darrell Court and all the wealth of the Darrells are not
worth it, Miss Hastings."</p>

<p>"Not worth what, Pauline?"</p>

<p>"Not worth the price I must pay."</p>

<p>"What is the price?" asked Miss Hastings, calmly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"My independence, my freedom of action and thought, my
liberty of speech."</p>

<p>"Do you seriously value these more highly than all that Sir
Oswald could leave you?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;a thousand times more highly," she replied.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings was silent for some few minutes, and then
said:</p>

<p>"We must do our best; suppose we make a compromise? I
will give you all the liberty that I honestly can, in every way, and
you shall give your attention to the studies I propose. I will
make your task as easy as I can for you. Darrell Court is worth
a struggle."</p>

<p>"Yes," was the half-reluctant reply, "it is worth a struggle,
and I will make it."</p>

<p>But there was not much hope in the heart of the governess
when she commenced her task.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PAULINE'S GOOD POINTS.</div>


<p>How often Sir Oswald's simile of the untrained, unpruned,
uncultivated vine returned to the mind of Miss Hastings!
Pauline Darrell was by nature a genius, a girl of magnificent intellect,
a grand, noble, generous being all untrained. She had
in her capabilities of the greatest kind&mdash;she could be either the
very empress of wickedness or angelic. She was gloriously endowed,
but it was impossible to tell how she would develop;
there was no moderation in her, she acted always from impulse,
and her impulses were quick, warm, and irresistible. If she
had been an actress, she would surely have been the very queen
of the stage. Her faults were like her virtues, all grand ones.
There was nothing trivial, nothing mean, nothing ungenerous
about her. She was of a nature likely to be led to the highest
criminality or the highest virtue; there could be no medium of
mediocre virtue for her. She was full of character, charming
even in her willfulness, but utterly devoid of all small affectations.
There was in her the making of a magnificent woman, a
great heroine; but nothing could have brought her to the level<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of commonplace people. Her character was almost a terrible
one in view of the responsibilities attached to it.</p>

<p>Grand, daring, original, Pauline was all force, all fire, all
passion. Whatever she loved, she loved with an intensity
almost terrible to witness. There was also no "middle way"
in her dislikes&mdash;she hated with a fury of hate. She had little
patience, little toleration; one of her greatest delights consisted
in ruthlessly tearing away the social vail which most people loved
to wear. There were times when her grand, pale, passionate
beauty seemed to darken and to deepen, and one felt instinctively
that it was in her to be cruel even to fierceness; and again,
when her heart was touched and her face softened, one imagined
that she might be <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'somewhut'">somewhat</ins> akin to the angels.</p>

<p>What was to become of such a nature? What was to develop
it&mdash;what was to train it? If from her infancy Pauline had been
under wise and tender guidance, if some mind that she felt to
be superior to her own had influenced her, the certainty is that
she would have grown up into a thoughtful, intellectual, talented
woman, one whose influence would have been paramount
for good, one to whom men would have looked for guidance
almost unconsciously to themselves.</p>

<p>But her training had been terribly defective. No one had
ever controlled her. She had been mistress of her father's house
and queen of his little coterie; with her quiet, unerring judgment,
she had made her own estimate of the strength, the
mind, the intellect of each one with whom she came in contact,
and the result was always favorable to herself&mdash;she saw no one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
superior to herself. Then the society in which her father had
delighted was the worst possible for her; she reigned supreme
over them all&mdash;clever, gifted artists, good-natured Bohemians,
who admired and applauded her, who praised every word that
fell from her lips, who honestly believed her to be one of the
marvels of the world, who told her continually that she was one
of the most beautiful, most talented, most charming of mortals,
who applauded every daring sentiment instead of telling her
plainly that what was not orthodox was seldom right&mdash;honest
Bohemians, who looked upon the child as a wonder, and puzzled
themselves to think what destiny was high enough for her&mdash;men
whose artistic tastes were gratified by the sight of her
magnificent loveliness, who had for her the deepest, truest, and
highest respect, who never in her presence uttered a syllable that
they would not have uttered in the presence of a child&mdash;good-natured
Bohemians, who sometimes had money and sometimes
had none, who were always willing to share their last <i>sou</i> with
others more needy than themselves, who wore shabby, threadbare
coats, but who knew how to respect the pure presence of a
pure girl.</p>

<p>Pauline had received a kind of education. Her father's friends
discussed everything&mdash;art, science, politics, and literature&mdash;in
her presence; they discussed the wildest stories, they indulged
in unbounded fun and satire, they were of the wittiest even as
they were of the cleverest of men. They ridiculed unmercifully
what they were pleased to call the "regulations of polite society;"
they enjoyed unvarnished truth&mdash;as a rule, the more disagreeable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the truth the more they delighted in telling it. They
scorned all etiquette, they pursued all dandies and belles with
terrible sarcasm; they believed in every wild or impossible
theory that had ever been started; in fact, though honest as the
day, honorable, and true, they were about the worst associates a
young girl could have had to fit her for the world. The life she
led among them had been one long romance, of which she had
been queen.</p>

<p>The house in the Rue d'Orme had once been a grand mansion;
it was filled with quaint carvings, old tapestry, and the
relics of a by-gone generation. The rooms were large&mdash;most of
them had been turned into studios. Some of the finest of
modern pictures came from the house in the Rue d'Orme,
although, as a rule, the students who worked there were not
wealthy.</p>

<p>It was almost amusing to see how this delicate young girl
ruled over such society. By one word she commanded these
great, generous, unworldly men&mdash;with one little white finger upraised
she could beckon them at her will; they had a hundred
pet names for her&mdash;they thought no queen or empress fit to be
compared with their old comrade's daughter. She was to be excused
if constant flattery and homage had made her believe that
she was in some way superior to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>When the great change came&mdash;when she left the Rue d'Orme
for Darrell Court&mdash;it was a terrible blow to Pauline to find all
this superiority vanish into thin air. In place of admiration and
flattery, she heard nothing but reproach and correction. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
was given to understand that she was hardly presentable in polite
society&mdash;she, who had ruled like a queen over scholars and
artists! Instead of laughter and applause, grim silence followed
her remarks. She read in the faces of those around her that
she was not as they were&mdash;not of their world. Her whole soul
turned longingly to the beautiful free Bohemian world she had
left. The crowning blow of all was when, after studying her
carefully for some time, Sir Oswald told her that he feared her
manners were against her&mdash;that neither in style nor in education
was she fitted to be mistress of Darrell Court. She had submitted
passively to the change in her name; she was proud of being
a Darrell&mdash;she was proud of the grand old race from which she
had sprung. But, when Sir Oswald had uttered that last speech,
she flamed out in fierce, violent passion, which showed him she
had at least the true Darrell spirit.</p>

<p>There were points in her favor, he admitted. She was magnificently
handsome&mdash;she had more courage and a higher spirit
than fall even to the lot of most men. She was a fearless horse-woman;
indeed it was only necessary for any pursuit to be
dangerous and to require unlimited courage for her instantly to
undertake it.</p>

<p>Would the balance at last turn in her favor? Would her
beauty, her spirits, her daring, her courage, outweigh defective
education, defective manner, and want of worldly knowledge?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE PUPIL.</div>


<p>It was a beautiful afternoon in June. May, with <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'is'">its</ins> lilac and
hawthorn, had passed away; the roses were in fairest bloom,
lilies looked like great white stars; the fullness and beauty, the
warmth and fragrance of summer were on the face of the land,
and everything living rejoiced in it.</p>

<p>Pauline had begged that the daily readings might take place
under the great cedar tree on the lawn.</p>

<p>"If I must be bored by dry historical facts," she said, "let
me at least have the lights and shadows on the lawn to look at.
The shadow of the trees on the grass is beautiful beyond everything
else. Oh, Miss Hastings, why will people write dull histories?
I like to fancy all kings heroes, and all queens heroines.
History leaves us no illusions."</p>

<p>"Still," replied the governess, "it teaches us plenty of what
you love so much&mdash;truth."</p>

<p>The beautiful face grew very serious and thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Why are so many truths disagreeable and sad? If I could
rule, I would have the world so bright, so fair and glad, every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
one so happy. I cannot understand all this under-current of
sorrow."</p>

<p>"Comte did not explain it, then, to your satisfaction?" said
Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>"Comte!" cried the girl, impatiently. "I am not obliged to
believe all I read! Once and for all, Miss Hastings, I do not
believe in Comte or his fellows. I only read what he wrote because
people seemed to think it clever to have done so. You
know&mdash;you must know&mdash;that I believe in our great Father.
Who could look round on this lovely world and not do so?"</p>

<p>Miss Hastings felt more hopeful of the girl then than she had
ever felt before. Such strange, wild theories had fallen at times
from her lips that it was some consolation to know she had still
a child's faith.</p>

<p>Then came an interruption in the shape of a footman, with
Sir Oswald's compliments, and would the ladies go to the drawing-room?
There were visitors.</p>

<p>"Who are they?" asked Miss Darrell, abruptly.</p>

<p>The man replied:</p>

<p>"Sir George and Lady Hampton."</p>

<p>"I shall not go," said Pauline, decidedly; "that woman
sickens me with her false airs and silly, false graces. I have not
patience to talk to her."</p>

<p>"Sir Oswald will not be pleased," remonstrated Miss
Hastings.</p>

<p>"That I cannot help&mdash;it is not my fault. I shall not make
myself a hypocrite to please Sir Oswald."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Society has duties which must be discharged, and which do
not depend upon our liking; we must do our duty whether we
like it or not."</p>

<p>"I detest society," was the abrupt reply&mdash;"it is all a sham!"</p>

<p>"Then why not do your best to improve it? That would
surely be better than to abuse it."</p>

<p>"There is something in that," confessed Miss Darrell, slowly.</p>

<p>"If we each do our little best toward making the world even
ever so little better than we found it," said Miss Hastings, "we
shall not have lived in vain."</p>

<p>There was a singular grandeur of generosity about the girl.
If she saw that she was wrong in an argument or an opinion,
she admitted it with the most charming candor. That admission
she made now by rising at once to accompany Miss
Hastings.</p>

<p>The drawing-room at Darrell Court was a magnificent apartment;
it had been furnished under the superintendence of the
late Lady Darrell, a lady of exquisite taste. It was all white and
gold, the white hangings with bullion fringe and gold braids,
the white damask with a delicate border of gold; the pictures,
the costly statues gleamed in the midst of rich and rare flowers;
graceful ornaments, tall, slender vases were filled with choicest
blossoms; the large mirrors, with their golden frames, were each
and all perfect in their way. There was nothing gaudy, brilliant,
or dazzling; all was subdued, in perfect good taste and
harmony.</p>

<p>In this superb room the beauty of Pauline Darrell always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
showed to great advantage; she was in perfect keeping with its
splendor. As she entered now, with her usual half-haughty,
half-listless grace, Sir Oswald looked up with admiration plainly
expressed on his face.</p>

<p>"What a queenly mistress she would make for the Court, if
she would but behave like other people!" he thought to himself,
and then Lady Hampton rose to greet the girl.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Darrell, I was getting quite impatient; it
seems an age since I saw you&mdash;really an age."</p>

<p>"It is an exceedingly short one," returned Pauline; "I saw
you on Tuesday, Lady Hampton."</p>

<p>"Did you? Ah, yes; how could I forget? Ah, my dear
child, when you reach my age&mdash;when your mind is filled with a
hundred different matters&mdash;you will not have such a good
memory as you have now."</p>

<p>Lady Hampton was a little, over-dressed woman. She looked
all flowers and furbelows&mdash;all ribbons and laces. She was,
however, a perfect mistress of all the arts of polite society; she
knew exactly what to say and how to say it; she knew when to
smile, when to look sympathetic, when to sigh. She was not
sincere; she never made the least pretense of being so. "Society"
was her one idea&mdash;how to please it, how to win its admiration,
how to secure a high position in it.</p>

<p>The contrast between the two was remarkable&mdash;the young
girl with her noble face, her grand soul looking out of her clear
dark eyes; Lady Hampton with her artificial smiles, her shifting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
glances, and would-be charming gestures. Sir Oswald stood by
with a courtly smile on his face.</p>

<p>"I have some charming news for you," said Lady Hampton.
"I am sure you will be pleased to hear it, Miss Darrell."</p>

<p>"That will quite depend on what it is like," interposed
Pauline, honestly.</p>

<p>"You dear, droll child! You are so original; you have so
much character. I always tell Sir Oswald you are quite different
from any one else."</p>

<p>And though her ladyship spoke smilingly, she gave a keen,
quiet glance at Sir Oswald's face, in all probability to watch the
effect of her words.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," she continued, "I suppose that in your position
a little singularity may be permitted," and then she paused, with
a bland smile.</p>

<p>"To what position do you allude?" asked Miss Darrell.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton laughed again. She nodded with an air of
great penetration.</p>

<p>"You are cautious, Miss Darrell. But I am forgetting my
news. It is this&mdash;that my niece, Miss Elinor Rocheford, is
coming to visit me."</p>

<p>She waited evidently for Miss Darrell to make some complimentary
reply. Not a word came from the proud lips.</p>

<p>"And when she comes I hope, Miss Darrell, that you and she
will be great friends."</p>

<p>"It is rather probable, if I like her," was the frank reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Oswald looked horrified. Lady Hampton smiled still
more sweetly.</p>

<p>"You are sure to like her. Elinor is most dearly loved wherever
she goes."</p>

<p>"Is she a sweet creature?" asked Pauline, with such inimitable
mimicry that Miss Hastings shuddered, while Sir Oswald
turned pale.</p>

<p>"She is indeed," replied Lady Hampton, who, if she understood
the sarcasm, made no sign. "With Sir Oswald's permission,
I shall bring her to spend a long day with you, Miss Darrell."</p>

<p>"I shall be charmed," said Sir Oswald&mdash;"really delighted,
Lady Hampton. You do me great honor indeed."</p>

<p>He looked at his niece for some little confirmation of his
words, but that young lady appeared too haughty for speech;
the word "honor" seemed to her strangely misapplied.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton relaxed none of her graciousness; her bland
suavity continued the same until the end of the visit; and then,
in some way, she contrived to make Miss Hastings understand
that she wanted to speak with her. She asked the governess if
she would go with her to the carriage, as she wished to consult
her about some music. When they were alone, her air and
manner changed abruptly. She turned eagerly to her, her eyes
full of sharp, keen curiosity.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me one thing?" she asked. "Is Sir Oswald
going to make that proud, stupid, illiterate girl his heiress&mdash;mistress
of Darrell Court?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Miss Hastings. "How should I
be able to answer such a question?"</p>

<p>"Of course I ask in confidence&mdash;only in strict confidence;
you understand that, Miss Hastings?"</p>

<p>"I understand," was the grave reply.</p>

<p>"All the county is crying shame on him," said her ladyship.
"A French painter's daughter. He must be mad to think of
such a thing. A girl brought up in the midst of Heaven knows
what. He never can intend to leave Darrell Court to her."</p>

<p>"He must leave it to some one," said Miss Hastings; "and
who has a better right to it than his own sister's child?"</p>

<p>"Let him marry," she suggested, hastily; "let him marry,
and leave it to children of his own. Do you think the county
will tolerate such a mistress for Darrell Court&mdash;so blunt, so ignorant?
Miss Hastings, he must marry."</p>

<p>"I can only suppose," replied the governess, "that he will
please himself, Lady Hampton, without any reference to the
county."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CAPTAIN LANGTON.</div>


<p>June, with its roses and lilies, passed on, the laburnums had
all fallen, the lilies had vanished, and still the state of affairs at
Darrell Court remained doubtful. Pauline, in many of those
respects in which her uncle would fain have seen her changed,
remained unaltered&mdash;indeed it was not easy to unlearn the teachings
of a life-time.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings, more patient and hopeful than Sir Oswald,
persevered, with infinite tact and discretion. But there were
certain peculiarities of which Pauline could not be broken.
One was a habit of calling everything by its right name. She
had no notion of using any of those polite little fictions society
delights in; no matter how harsh, how ugly the word, she did
not hesitate to use it. Another peculiarity was that of telling
the blunt, plain, abrupt truth, no matter what the cost, no matter
who was pained. She tore aside the flimsy vail of society
with zest; she spared no one in her almost ruthless denunciations.
Her intense scorn for all kinds of polite fiction was somewhat
annoying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"You need not say that I am engaged, James," she said, one
day, when a lady called whom she disliked. "I am not engaged,
but I do not care to see Mrs. Camden."</p>

<p>Even that bland functionary looked annoyed. Miss Hastings
tried to make some compromise.</p>

<p>"You cannot send such a message as that, Miss Darrell.
Pray listen to reason."</p>

<p>"Sir Oswald and yourself agreed that she was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind that," hastily interrupted Miss Hastings. "You
must not hurt any one's feelings by such a blunt message as
that; it is neither polite nor well-bred."</p>

<p>"I shall never cultivate either politeness or good breeding at
the expense of truth; therefore you had better send the message
yourself, Miss Hastings."</p>

<p>"I will do so," said the governess, quietly. "I will manage
it in such a way as to show Mrs. Camden that she is not expected
to call again, yet so as not to humiliate her before the servants;
but, remember, not at any sacrifice of truth."</p>

<p>Such contests were of daily, almost hourly, occurrence.
Whether the result would be such a degree of training as to fit
the young lady for taking the position she wished to occupy,
remained doubtful.</p>

<p>"This is really very satisfactory," said Sir Oswald, abruptly,
one morning, as he entered the library, where Miss Hastings
awaited him. "But," he continued, "before I explain myself,
let me ask you how are you getting on&mdash;what progress are you
making with your tiresome pupil?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The gentle heart of the governess was grieved to think that
she could not give a more satisfactory reply. Little real progress
had been made in study; less in manner.</p>

<p>"There is a mass of splendid material, Sir Oswald," she said;
"but the difficulty lies in putting it into shape."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," he observed, "people will make remarks;
and I have heard more than one doubt expressed as to what
kind of hands Darrell Court is likely to fall into should I make
Pauline my heiress. You see she is capable of almost anything.
She would turn the place into an asylum; she would transform
it into a college for philosophers, a home for needy artists&mdash;in
fact, anything that might occur to her&mdash;without the least hesitation."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings could not deny it. They were not speaking of
a manageable nineteenth century young lady, but of one to
whom no ordinary rules applied, whom no customary measures
fitted.</p>

<p>"I have a letter here," continued Sir Oswald, "from Captain
Aubrey Langton, the son of one of my oldest and dearest friends.
He proposes to pay me a visit, and&mdash;pray, Miss Hastings, pardon
me for suggesting such a thing, but I should be so glad if
he would fall in love with Pauline. I have an idea that love
might educate and develop her more quickly than anything
else."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings had already thought the same thing; but she
knew whoever won the love of such a girl as Pauline Darrell
would be one of the cleverest of men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am writing to him to tell him that I hope he will remain
with us for a month; and during that time I hope, I fervently
hope, he may fall in love with my niece. She is beautiful
enough. Pardon me again, Miss Hastings, but has she ever
spoken to you of love or lovers?"</p>

<p>"No. She is in that respect, as in many others, quite unlike
the generality of girls. I have never heard an allusion to such
matters from her lips&mdash;never once."</p>

<p>This fact seemed to Sir Oswald stranger than any other; he
had an idea that girls devoted the greater part of their thoughts
to such subjects.</p>

<p>"Do you think," he inquired, "that she cared for any one in
Paris&mdash;any of those men, for instance, whom she used to meet
at her father's?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Miss Hastings; "I do not think so. She is
strangely backward in all such respects, although she was
brought up entirely among gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Among&mdash;pardon me, my dear madame, not gentlemen&mdash;members,
we will say, of a gentlemanly profession."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald took from his gold snuff-box a pinch of most delicately-flavored
snuff, and looked as though he thought the very
existence of such people a mistake.</p>

<p>"Any little influence that you may possess over my niece,
Miss Hastings, will you kindly use in Captain Langton's favor?
Of course, if anything should come of my plan&mdash;as I fervently
hope there may&mdash;I shall stipulate that the engagement lasts two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
years. During that time I shall trust to the influence of love to
change my niece's character."</p>

<p>It was only a fresh complication&mdash;one from which Miss Hastings
did not expect much.</p>

<p>That same day, during dinner, Sir Oswald told his niece of
the expected arrival of Captain Langton.</p>

<p>"I have seen so few English gentlemen," she remarked,
"that he will be a subject of some curiosity to me."</p>

<p>"You will find him&mdash;that is, if he resembles his father&mdash;a
high-bred, noble gentleman," said Sir Oswald, complacently.</p>

<p>"Is he clever?" she asked. "What does he do?"</p>

<p>"Do!" repeated Sir Oswald. "I do not understand you."</p>

<p>"Does he paint pictures or write books?"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" cried Sir Oswald, proudly. "He is a gentleman."</p>

<p>Her face flushed hotly for some minutes, and then the flush
died away, leaving her paler than ever.</p>

<p>"I consider artists and writers gentlemen," she retorted&mdash;"gentlemen
of a far higher stamp than those to whom fortune
has given money and nature has denied brains."</p>

<p>Another time a sharp argument would have resulted from the
throwing down of such a gantlet. Sir Oswald had something
else in view, so he allowed the speech to pass.</p>

<p>"It will be a great pleasure for me to see my old friend's son
again," he said. "I hope, Pauline, you will help me to make
his visit a pleasant one."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" she asked, brusquely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a question!" laughed Sir Oswald. "Say, rather,
what can you not do? Talk to him, sing to him. Your voice
is magnificent, and would give any one the greatest pleasure.
You can ride out with him."</p>

<p>"If he is a clever, sensible man, I can do all that you mention;
if not, I shall not trouble myself about him. I never
could endure either tiresome or stupid people."</p>

<p>"My young friend is not likely to prove either," said Sir
Oswald, angrily; and Miss Hastings wondered in her heart what
the result of it all would be.</p>

<p>That same evening Miss Darrell talked of Captain Langton,
weaving many bright fancies concerning him.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she said, "that it is not always the most favorable
specimens of the English who visit Paris. We used to see
such droll caricatures. I like a good caricature above all things&mdash;do
you, Miss Hastings?"</p>

<p>"When it is good, and pains no one," was the sensible reply.</p>

<p>The girl turned away with a little impatient sigh.</p>

<p>"Your ideas are all colorless," she said, sharply. "In England
it seems to me that everybody is alike. You have no individuality,
no character."</p>

<p>"If character means, in your sense of the word, ill-nature,
so much the better," rejoined Miss Hastings. "All good-hearted
people strive to save each other from pain."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Pauline, thoughtfully, "if I shall like Captain
Langton! We have been living here quietly enough; but
I feel as though some great change were coming. You have no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
doubt experienced that peculiar sensation which comes over one
just before a heavy thunder-storm? I have that strange, half-nervous,
half-restless sensation now."</p>

<p>"You will try to be amiable, Pauline," put in the governess,
quietly. "You see that Sir Oswald evidently thinks a great
deal of this young friend of his. You will try not to shock
your uncle in any way&mdash;not to violate those little conventionalities
that he respects so much."</p>

<p>"I will do my best; but I must be myself&mdash;always myself.
I cannot assume a false character."</p>

<p>"Then let it be your better self," said the governess, gently;
and for one minute Pauline Darrell was touched.</p>

<p>"That sweet creature, Lady Hampton's niece, will be here
next week," she remarked, after a short pause. "What changes
will be brought into our lives, I wonder?"</p>

<p>Of all the changes possible, least of all she expected the
tragedy that afterward happened.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE INTRODUCTION.</div>


<p>It was a never-to-be-forgotten evening when Captain Langton
reached Darrell Court&mdash;an evening fair, bright, and calm. The
sweet southern wind bore the perfume of flowers; the faint ripples
of the fountains, the musical song of the birds, seemed
almost to die away on the evening breeze; the sun appeared
unwilling to leave the sapphire sky, the flowers unwilling to
close. Pauline had lingered over her books until she could remain
in-doors no longer; then, by Miss Hastings' desire, she
dressed for dinner&mdash;which was delayed for an hour&mdash;and afterward
went into the garden.</p>

<p>Most girls would have remembered, as they dressed, that a
handsome young officer was coming; Miss Darrell did not
make the least change in her usual toilet. The thin, fine dress
of crape fell in statuesque folds round the splendid figure; the
dark hair was drawn back from the beautiful brow, and negligently
fastened with her favorite silver arrow; the white neck
and fair rounded arms gleamed like white marble through the
thin folds of crape. There was not the least attempt at ornament;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
yet no queen arrayed in royal robes ever looked more
lovely.</p>

<p>Pauline was a great lover of the picturesque. With a single
flower, a solitary knot of ribbon, she could produce an effect
which many women would give all their jewels to achieve.
Whatever she wore took a kind of royal grace from herself which
no other person could impart. Though her dress might be
made of the same material as that of others, it never looked the
same. On her it appeared like the robes of a queen.</p>

<p>As Pauline was passing through the corridor, Miss Hastings
met her. The governess looked scrutinizingly at the plain evening
dress; it was the same that she had worn yesterday. Evidently
there was no girlish desire to attract.</p>

<p>"Pauline, we shall have a visitor this evening," said Miss
Hastings; "you might add a few flowers to your dress."</p>

<p>She passed on, with a smile of assent. Almost the first thing
that caught her attention out of doors was a large and handsome
fuchsia. She gathered a spray of the rich purple and crimson
flowers, and placed it negligently in her hair. Many women
would have stood before their mirror for an hour without producing
the same superb effect. Then she placed another spray
of the same gorgeous flowers in the bodice of her dress. It
was all done without effort, and she would have been the last in
the world to suspect how beautiful she looked. Then she went
on to the fountain, for the beautiful, calm evening had awakened
all the poet's soul within her. The grand, sensitive nature
thrilled&mdash;the beautiful, poetic mind reveled in this hour of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
nature's most supreme loveliness. A thousand bright fancies
surged through her heart and brain; a thousand poetical ideas
shaped themselves into words, and rose to her lips.</p>

<p>So time passed, and she was unconscious of it, until a shadow
falling over the great white lilies warned her that some one was
near.</p>

<p>Looking up quickly, she saw a tall, fair, handsome young
man gazing at her with mingled admiration and surprise. Beside
him stood Sir Oswald, courtly, gracious, and evidently on
the alert.</p>

<p>"Captain Langton," he said, "let me introduce you to my
niece, Miss Darrell."</p>

<p>Not one feature of the girl's proud, beautiful face moved, but
there was some little curiosity in her dark eyes. They rested for
a minute on the captain's face, and then, with a dreamy look,
she glanced over the heads of the white lilies behind him. He
was not her ideal, not her hero, evidently. In that one keen,
quick glance, she read not only the face, but the heart and soul
of the man before her.</p>

<p>The captain felt as though he had been subjected to some
wonderful microscopic examination.</p>

<p>"She is one of those dreadfully shrewd girls that pretend to
read faces," he said to himself, while he bowed low before her,
and replied with enthusiasm to the introduction.</p>

<p>"My niece is quite a Darrell," said Sir Oswald, proudly.
"You see she has the Darrell face."</p>

<p>Again the gallant captain offered some flattering remark&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
neatly turned compliment, which he considered ought to have
brought her down, as a skillful shot does a bird&mdash;but the dark
eyes saw only the lilies, not him.</p>

<p>"She is proud, like all the Darrells," he thought; "my father
always said they were the proudest race in England."</p>

<p>"I hope," said Sir Oswald, courteously, "that you will enjoy
your visit here, Aubrey. Your father was my dearest friend, and
it gives me great delight to see you here."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it, Sir Oswald. I am equally happy; I cannot
see how any one could be dull for one minute in this grand
old place."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald's face flushed with pleasure, and for the first
time the dark eyes slowly left the lilies and looked at the captain.</p>

<p>"I find not only one minute, but many hours in which to be
dull," said Pauline. "Do you like the country so well?"</p>

<p>"I like Darrell Court," he replied, with a bow that seemed to
embrace Sir Oswald, his niece, and all his possessions.</p>

<p>"You like it&mdash;in what way?" asked Pauline, in her terribly
downright manner. "It is your first visit, and you have been
here only a few minutes. How can you tell whether you like
it?"</p>

<p>For a few moments Captain Langton looked slightly confused,
and then he rallied. Surely a man of the world was not to be
defied by a mere girl.</p>

<p>"I have seen that at Darrell Court," he said, deferentially,
"which will make the place dear to me while I live."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not understand him. She was far too frank and
haughty for a compliment so broad. But Sir Oswald smiled.</p>

<p>"He is losing no time," thought the stately old baronet;
"he is falling in love with her, just as I guessed he would."</p>

<p>"I will leave you," said Sir Oswald, "to get better acquainted.
Pauline, you will show Captain Langton the aviary."</p>

<p>"Yes," she assented, carelessly. "But will you send Miss
Hastings here? She knows the various birds far better than I
do."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald, with a pleased expression on his face, walked
away.</p>

<p>"So you have an aviary at the Court, Miss Darrell. It seems
to me there is nothing wanting here. You do not seem interested;
you do not like birds?"</p>

<p>"Not caged ones," she replied. "I love birds almost as
though they were living friends, but not bright-plumaged birds
in golden cages. They should be free and wild in the woods
and forests, filling the summer air with joyous song. I love
them well then."</p>

<p>"You like unrestricted freedom?" he observed.</p>

<p>"I do not merely like it, I deem it an absolute necessity. I
should not care for life without it."</p>

<p>The captain looked more attentively at her. It was the Darrell
face, surely enough&mdash;features of perfect beauty, with a soul
of fire shining through them.</p>

<p>"Yet," he said, musingly, cautiously feeling his way, "there
is but little freedom&mdash;true freedom&mdash;for women. They are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
bound down by a thousand narrow laws and observances&mdash;caged
by a thousand restraints."</p>

<p>"There is no power on earth," she returned, hastily, "that
can control thoughts or cage souls; while they are free, it is untrue
to say that there is no freedom."</p>

<p>A breath of fragrant wind came and stirred the great white
lilies. The gallant captain saw at once that he should only lose
in arguments with her.</p>

<p>"Shall we visit the aviary?" he asked.</p>

<p>And she walked slowly down the path, he following.</p>

<p>"She is like an empress," he thought. "It will be all the
more glory for me if I can win such a wife for my own."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BROKEN LILY.</div>


<p>Pauline Darrell was a keen, shrewd observer of character.
She judged more by small actions than by great ones; it was a
characteristic of hers. When women have that gift, it is more
to be dreaded than the cool, calm, matured judgment of men.
Men err sometimes in their estimate of character, but it is very
seldom that a woman makes a similar mistake.</p>

<p>The garden path widened where the tall white lilies grew in
rich profusion, and there Pauline and Captain Langton walked
side by side. The rich, sweet perfume seemed to gather round
them, and the dainty flowers, with their shining leaves and golden
bracts, looked like great white stars.</p>

<p>Captain Langton carried a small cane in his hand. He had
begun to talk to Pauline with great animation. Her proud indifference
piqued him. He was accustomed to something more
like rapture when he devoted himself to any fair lady. He
vowed to himself that he would vanquish her pride, that he
would make her care for him, that the proud, dark eyes should
soften and brighten for him; and he gave his whole mind to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
conquest. As he walked along, one of the tall, white lilies
bent over the path; with one touch of the cane he beat it down,
and Pauline gave a little cry, as though the blow had pained
her. She stopped, and taking the slender green stem in her
hand, straightened it; but the blow had broken one of the
white leaves.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" she asked, in a pained voice.</p>

<p>"It is only a flower," he replied, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Only a flower! You have killed it. You cannot make it
live again. Why need you have cut its sweet life short?"</p>

<p>"It will not be missed from among so many," he said.</p>

<p>"You might say the same thing of yourself," she retorted.
"The world is full of men, and you would hardly be missed
from so many; yet you would not like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is some little difference between a man and a flower,
Miss Darrell," he interrupted, stiffly.</p>

<p>"There is, indeed; and the flowers have the advantage," she
retorted.</p>

<p>The captain solaced himself by twisting his mustache, and relieved
his feelings by some few muttered words, which Miss
Darrell did not hear. In her quick, impulsive way, she judged
him at once.</p>

<p>"He is cruel and selfish," she thought; "he would not even
stoop to save the life of the sweetest flower that blows. He
shall not forget killing that lily," she continued, as she gathered
the broken chalice, and placed it in her belt. "Every time he
looks at me," she said, "he shall remember what he has done."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain evidently understood her amiable intention, and
liked her accordingly. They walked on for some minutes in
perfect silence; then Pauline turned to him suddenly.</p>

<p>"Have you been long in the army, Captain Langton?"</p>

<p>Flattered by a question that seemed to evince some personal
interest, he hastened to reply:</p>

<p>"More than eight years. I joined when I was twenty."</p>

<p>"Have you seen any service?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "My regiment had been for many years
in active service just before I joined, so that we have been at
home since then."</p>

<p>"In inglorious ease," she said.</p>

<p>"We are ready for work," he returned, "when work comes."</p>

<p>"How do you employ your time?" she asked; and again he
was flattered by the interest that the question showed. His face
flushed. Here was a grand opportunity of showing this haughty
girl, this "proudest Darrell of them all," that he was eagerly
sought after in society such as she had not yet seen.</p>

<p>"You have no conception of the immense number of engagements
that occupy our time," he replied; "I am fond of
horses&mdash;I take a great interest in all races."</p>

<p>If he had added that he was one of the greatest gamblers on
the turf, he would have spoken truthfully.</p>

<p>"Horse racing," said Miss Darrell&mdash;"that is the favorite occupation
of English gentlemen, is it not?"</p>

<p>"I should imagine so. Then I am considered&mdash;you must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
pardon my boasting&mdash;one of the best billiard players in London."</p>

<p>"That is not much of a boast," she remarked, with such
quiet contempt that the captain could only look at her in sheer
wonder.</p>

<p>"There are balls, operas, parties, suppers&mdash;I cannot tell
what; and the ladies engross a great deal of our time. We soldiers
never forget our devotion and chivalry to the fair sex, Miss
Darrell."</p>

<p>"The fair sex should be grateful that they share your attention
with horses and billiards," she returned. "But what else
do you do, Captain Langton? I was not thinking of such trifles
as these."</p>

<p>"Trifles!" he repeated. "I do not call horse racing a trifle.
I was within an inch of winning the Derby&mdash;I mean to say a
horse of mine was. If you call that a trifle, Miss Darrell, you
go near to upsetting English society altogether."</p>

<p>"But what great things do you do?" she repeated, her dark
eyes opening wider. "You cannot mean seriously that this is
all. Do you never write, paint&mdash;have you no ambition at all?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what you call ambition," he replied, sullenly;
"as for writing and painting, in England we pay people to do
that kind of thing for us. You do not think that I would
paint a picture, even if I could?"</p>

<p>"I should think you clever if you did that," she returned;
"at present I cannot see that you do anything requiring mind
or intellect."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Darrell," he said, looking at her, "you are a radical,
I believe."</p>

<p>"A radical?" she repeated, slowly. "I am not quite sure,
Captain Langton, that I know what that means."</p>

<p>"You believe in aristocracy of intellect, and all that kind of
nonsense," he continued. "Why should a man who paints a
picture be any better than the man who understands the good
points of a horse?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed?" she asked, satirically. "We will not argue
the question, for we should not agree."</p>

<p>"I had her there," thought the captain. "She could not
answer me. Some of these women require a high hand to keep
them in order."</p>

<p>"I do not see Miss Hastings," she said at last, "and it is
quite useless going to the aviary without her. I do not remember
the name of a single bird; and I am sure you will not care
for them."</p>

<p>"But," he returned, hesitatingly, "Sir Oswald seemed to
wish it."</p>

<p>"There is the first dinner-bell," she said, with an air of great
relief; "there will only just be time to return. As you seem
solicitous about Sir Oswald's wishes we had better go in, for he
dearly loves punctuality."</p>

<p>"I believe," thought the captain, "that she is anxious to get
away from me. I must say that I am not accustomed to this
kind of thing."</p>

<p>The aspect of the dining-room, with its display of fine old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
plate, the brilliantly arranged tables, the mingled odor of rare
wines and flowers, restored him to good humor.</p>

<p>"It would be worth some little trouble," he thought, "to win
all this."</p>

<p>He took Pauline in to dinner. The grand, pale, passionate
beauty of the girl had never shown to greater advantage than it
did this evening, as she sat with the purple and crimson fuchsias
in her hair and the broken lily in her belt. Sir Oswald did not
notice the latter until dinner was half over. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Why, Pauline, with gardens and hothouses full of flowers,
have you chosen a broken one?"</p>

<p>"To me it is exquisite," she replied.</p>

<p>The captain's face darkened for a moment, but he would not
take offense. The elegantly appointed table, the seductive dinner,
the rare wines, all made an impression on him. He said
to himself that there was a good thing offered to him, and that
a girl's haughty temper should not stand in his way. He made
himself most agreeable, he was all animation, vivacity, and high
spirits with Sir Oswald. He was deferential and attentive to
Miss Hastings, and his manner to Pauline left no doubt in the
minds of the lookers on that he was completely fascinated by
her. She was too proudly indifferent, too haughtily careless,
even to resent it. Sir Oswald Darrell was too true a gentleman
to offer his niece to any one; but he had given the captain to
understand that, if he could woo her and win her, there would
be no objection raised on his part.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>For once in his life Captain Langton had spoken quite truthfully.</p>

<p>"I have nothing," he said; "my father left me but a very
moderate fortune, and I have lost the greater part of it. I have
not been careful or prudent, Sir Oswald."</p>

<p>"Care and prudence are not the virtues of youth," Sir Oswald
returned. "I may say, honestly, I should be glad if your
father's son could win my niece; as for fortune, she will be richly
dowered if I make her my heiress. Only yesterday I heard that
coal had been found on my Scotch estates, and, if that be true,
it will raise my income many thousands per annum."</p>

<p>"May you long live to enjoy your wealth, Sir Oswald!" said
the young man, so heartily that tears stood in the old baronet's
eyes.</p>

<p>But there was one thing the gallant captain did not confess.
He did not tell Sir Oswald Darrell&mdash;what was really the truth&mdash;that
he was over head and ears in debt, and that this visit to
Darrell Court was the last hope left to him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PAULINE STILL INCORRIGIBLE.</div>


<p>Sir Oswald lingered over his wine. It was not every day that
he found a companion so entirely to his taste as Captain Langton.
The captain had a collection of anecdotes of the court,
the aristocracy, and the mess-room, that could not be surpassed.
He kept his own interest well in view the whole time, making
some modest allusions to the frequency with which his society
was sought, and the number of ladies who were disposed to regard
him favorably. All was narrated with the greatest skill,
without the least boasting, and Sir Oswald, as he listened with
delight, owned to himself that, all things considered, he could
not have chosen more wisely for his niece.</p>

<p>A second bottle of fine old port was discussed, and then Sir
Oswald said:</p>

<p>"You will like to go to the drawing-room; the ladies will be
there. I always enjoy forty winks after dinner."</p>

<p>The prospect of a <i>tete-a-tete</i> with Miss Darrell did not strike
the captain as being a very rapturous one.</p>

<p>"She is," he said to himself, "a magnificently handsome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
girl, but almost too haughty to be bearable. I have never, in
all my life, felt so small as I do when she speaks to me or looks
at me, and no man likes that sort of thing."</p>

<p>But Darrell Court was a magnificent estate, the large annual
income was a sum he had never even dreamed of, and all might
be his&mdash;Sir Oswald had said so; his, if he could but win the
proud heart of the proudest girl it had ever been his fortune to
meet. The stake was well worth going through something disagreeable
for.</p>

<p>"If she were only like other women," he thought, "I should
know how to manage her; but she seems to live in the clouds."</p>

<p>The plunge had to be made, so the captain summoned all his
courage, and went to the drawing-room. The picture there
must have struck the least imaginative of men.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings, calm, elegant, lady-like, in her quiet evening
dress of gray silk, was seated near a small stand on which stood
a large lamp, by the light of which she was reading. The part
of the room near her was brilliantly illuminated. It was a spacious
apartment&mdash;unusually so even for a large mansion. It
contained four large windows, two of which were closed, the
gorgeous hangings of white and gold shielding them from view;
the other end of the room was in semi-darkness, the brilliant
light from the lamp not reaching it&mdash;the windows were thrown
wide open, and the soft, pale moonlight came in. The evening
came in, too, bringing with it the sweet breath of the lilies, the
perfume of the roses, the fragrance of rich clover, carnations,
and purple heliotropes. Faint shadows lay on the flowers, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
white silvery light was very peaceful and sweet; the dewdrops
shone on the grass&mdash;it was the fairest hour of nature's fair day.</p>

<p>Pauline had gone to the open window. Something had made
her restless and unquiet; but, standing there, the spell of that
beautiful moonlit scene calmed her, and held her fast. With
one look at that wonderful sky and its myriad stars, one at the
soft moonlight and the white lilies, the fever of life died from
her, and a holy calm, sweet fancies, bright thoughts, swept over
her like an angel's wing.</p>

<p>Then she became conscious of a stir in the perfumed air;
something less agreeable mingled with the fragrance of the lilies
scent of which she did not know the name, but which&mdash;some
she disliked ever afterward because the captain used it. A low
voice that would fain be tender murmured something in her
ear; the spell of the moonlight was gone, the quickly thronging
poetical fancies had all fled away, the beauty seemed to have
left even the sleeping flowers. Turning round to him, she said,
in a clear voice, every word sounding distinctly:</p>

<p>"Have the goodness, Captain Langton, not to startle me
again. I do not like any one to come upon me in that unexpected
manner."</p>

<p>"I was so happy to find you alone," he whispered.</p>

<p>"I do not know why that should make you happy. I always
behave much better when I am with Miss Hastings than when I
am alone."</p>

<p>"You are always charming," he said. "I want to ask you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
something, Miss Darrell. Be kind, be patient, and listen to
me."</p>

<p>"I am neither kind nor patient by nature," she returned;
"what have you to say?"</p>

<p>It was very difficult, he felt, to be sentimental with her. She
had turned to the window, and was looking out again at the
flowers; one little white hand played impatiently with a branch
of guelder roses that came peeping in.</p>

<p>"I am jealous of those flowers," said the captain; "will you
look at me instead of them?"</p>

<p>She raised her beautiful eyes, and looked at him so calmly,
with so much conscious superiority in her manner, that the captain
felt "smaller" than ever.</p>

<p>"You are talking nonsense to me," she said, loftily; "and
as I do not like nonsense, will you tell me what you have to
say?"</p>

<p>The voice was calm and cold, the tones measured and slightly
contemptuous; it was very difficult under such circumstances to
be an eloquent wooer, but the recollection of Darrell Court and
its large rent-roll came to him and restored his fast expiring
courage.</p>

<p>"I want to ask a favor of you," he said; and the pleading
expression that he managed to throw into his face was really
creditable to him. "I want to ask you if you will be a little
kinder to me. I admire you so much that I should be the happiest
man in all the world if you would but give me ever so little
of your friendship."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>She seemed to consider his words&mdash;to ponder them; and from
her silence he took hope.</p>

<p>"I am quite unworthy, I know; but, if you knew how all
my life long I have desired the friendship of a good and noble
woman, you would be kinder to me&mdash;you would indeed!"</p>

<p>"Do you think, then, that I am good and noble?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it; your face&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish," she interrupted, "that Sir Oswald were of your
opinion. You have lived in what people call 'the world' all
your life, Captain Langton, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, wondering what would follow.</p>

<p>"You have been in society all that time, yet I am the first
'good and noble woman' you have met! You are hardly complimentary
to the sex, after all."</p>

<p>The captain was slightly taken aback.</p>

<p>"I did not say those exact words, Miss Darrell."</p>

<p>"But you implied them. Tell me why you wish for my
friendship more than any other. Miss Hastings is ten thousand
times more estimable than I am&mdash;why not make her your
friend?"</p>

<p>"I admire you&mdash;I like you. I could say more, but I dare
not. You are hard upon me, Miss Darrell."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to be hard," she returned. "Who am I
that I should be hard upon any one? But, you see, I am unfortunately
what people call very plain-spoken&mdash;very truthful."</p>

<p>"So much the better," said Captain Langton.</p>

<p>"Is it? Sir Oswald says not. If he does not make me his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
heiress, it will be because I have such an abrupt manner of
speaking; he often tells me so."</p>

<p>"Truth in a beautiful woman," began the captain, sentimentally;
but Miss Darrell again interrupted him&mdash;she had little patience
with his platitudes.</p>

<p>"You say you wish for my friendship because you like me.
Now, here is the difficulty&mdash;I cannot give it to you, because I
do not like you."</p>

<p>"You do not like me?" cried the captain, hardly able to believe
the evidence of his own senses. "You cannot mean it!
You are the first person who ever said such a thing!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am not the first who ever thought it; but then,
as I tell you, I am very apt to say what I think."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me why you do not like me?" asked the captain,
quietly. He began to see that nothing could be gained in
any other fashion.</p>

<p>Her beautiful face was raised quite calmly to his, her dark
eyes were as proudly serene as ever, she was utterly unconscious
that she was saying anything extraordinary.</p>

<p>"I will tell you with pleasure," she replied. "You seem to
me wanting in truth and earnestness; you think people are to
be pleased by flattery. You flatter Sir Oswald, you flatter Miss
Hastings, you flatter me. Being agreeable is all very well, but
an honest man does not need to flatter&mdash;does not think of it, in
fact. Then, you are either heedless or cruel&mdash;I do not know
which. Why should you kill that beautiful flower that Heaven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
made to enjoy the sunshine, just for one idle moment's wanton
sport?"</p>

<p>Captain Langton's face grew perfectly white with anger.</p>

<p>"Upon my word of honor," he said, "I never heard anything
like this!"</p>

<p>Miss Darrell turned carelessly away.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, "friendship between us would be rather
difficult. But I will not judge too hastily; I will wait a few
days, and then decide."</p>

<p>She had quitted the room before Captain Langton had sufficiently
recovered from his dismay to answer.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOW WILL IT END?</div>


<p>It was some minutes before Captain Langton collected himself
sufficiently to cross the room and speak to Miss Hastings.
She looked up at him with a smile.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have not had a very pleasant time of it at
that end of the room, Captain Langton," she said; "I was just
on the point of interfering."</p>

<p>"Your pupil is a most extraordinary young lady, Miss Hastings,"
he returned; "I have never met with any one more so."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings laughed; there was an expression of great
amusement on her face.</p>

<p>"She is certainly very original, Captain Langton; quite different
from the pattern young lady of the present day."</p>

<p>"She is magnificently handsome," he continued; "but her
manners are simply startling."</p>

<p>"She has very grand qualities," said Miss Hastings; "she
has a noble disposition and a generous heart, but the want of
early training, the mixing entirely with one class of society, has
made her very strange."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Strange!" cried the captain. "I have never met with any
one so blunt, so outspoken, so abrupt, in all my life. She has
no notion of repose or polish; I have never been so surprised.
I hear Sir Oswald coming, and really, Miss Hastings, I feel that
I cannot see him; I am not equal to it&mdash;that extraordinary girl
has quite unsettled me. You might mention that I have gone
out in the grounds to smoke my cigar; I cannot talk to any
one."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings laughed as he passed out through the open
French window into the grounds. Sir Oswald came in, smiling
and contented; he talked for a few minutes with Miss Hastings,
and heard that the captain was smoking his cigar. He expressed
to Miss Hastings his very favorable opinion of the young
man, and then bade her good-night.</p>

<p>"How will it end?" said the governess to herself. "She will
never marry him, I am sure. Those proud, clear, dark eyes of
hers look through all his little airs and graces; her grand soul
seems to understand all the narrowness and selfishness of his.
She will never marry him. Oh, if she would but be civilized!
Sir Oswald is quite capable of leaving all he has to the captain,
and then what would become of Pauline?"</p>

<p>By this time the gentle, graceful governess had become warmly
attached to the beautiful, wayward, willful girl who persisted
so obstinately in refusing what she chose to call "polish."</p>

<p>"How will it end?" said the governess. "I would give all I
have to see Pauline mistress of Darrell Court; but I fear the
future."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the scenes that took place between Miss Darrell and
the captain were very amusing. She had the utmost contempt
for his somewhat dandified airs, his graces, and affectations.</p>

<p>"I like a grand, rugged, noble man, with the head of a hero,
and the brow of a poet, the heart of a lion, and the smile of a
child," she said to him one day; "I cannot endure a coxcomb."</p>

<p>"I hope you may find such a man, Miss Darrell," he returned,
quietly. "I have been some time in the world, but I have
never met with such a character."</p>

<p>"I think your world has been a very limited one," she replied,
and the captain looked angry.</p>

<p>He had certainly hoped and intended to dazzle her with his
worldly knowledge, if nothing else. Yet how she despised his
knowledge, and with what contempt she heard him speak of his
various experiences!</p>

<p>Nothing seemed to jar upon her and to irritate her as did his
affectations. She was looking one morning at a very beautifully
veined leaf, which she passed over to Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>"Is it not wonderful?" she asked; and the captain, with his
eye-glass, came to look at it.</p>

<p>"Are you short-sighted?" she asked him, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," he replied.</p>

<p>"Is your sight defective?" she continued.</p>

<p>"No, not in the least degree."</p>

<p>"Then why do you use that eye-glass, Captain Langton?"</p>

<p>"I-ah-why, because everybody uses one," he replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought it was only women who did that kind of thing&mdash;followed
a fashion for fashion's sake," she said, with some little
contempt.</p>

<p>The next morning the captain descended without his eye-glass,
and Miss Hastings smiled as she noticed it.</p>

<p>Another of his affectations was a pretended inability to pronounce
his "t's" and "r's."</p>

<p>"Can you really not speak plainly?" she said to him one day.</p>

<p>"Most decidedly I can," he replied, wondering what was
coming next.</p>

<p>"Then, why do you call 'rove' 'wove' in that absurd
fashion?"</p>

<p>The captain's face flushed.</p>

<p>"It is a habit I have fallen into, I suppose," he replied. "I
must break myself of it."</p>

<p>"It is about the most effeminate habit a man can fall into,"
said Miss Darrell. "I think that, if I were a soldier, I should
delight in clear, plain speaking. I cannot understand why
English gentlemen seem to think it fashionable to mutilate their
mother tongue."</p>

<p>There was no chance of their ever agreeing&mdash;they never did
even for one single hour.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about, Pauline?" asked Miss Hastings
one day.</p>

<p>Her young pupil had fallen into a reverie over "The History
of the Peninsular War."</p>

<p>"I am thinking," she replied, "that, although France boasts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
so much of her military glory, England has a superior army;
her soldiers are very brave; her officers the truest gentlemen."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that you think so. I have often wondered
if you would take our guest as a sample."</p>

<p>Her beautiful lips curled with unutterable contempt.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I often contrast him with a Captain Lafosse,
who used to visit us in the Rue d'Orme, a grand man with a
brown, rugged face, and great brown hands. Captain Langton
is a coxcomb&mdash;neither more nor less, Miss Hastings."</p>

<p>"But he is polished, refined, elegant in his manner and
address, which, perhaps, your friend with the brown, rugged
face was not."</p>

<p>"We shall not agree, Miss Hastings, we shall not agree. I
do not like Captain Langton."</p>

<p>The governess, remembering all that Sir Oswald wished, tried
in vain to represent their visitor in a more favorable light. Miss
Darrell simply looked haughty and unconvinced.</p>

<p>"I am years younger than you," she said, at last, "and have
seen nothing of what you call 'life'; but the instinct of my own
heart tells me that he is false in heart, in mind, in soul; he has
a false, flattering tongue, false lips, false principles&mdash;we will not
speak of him."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings looked at her sadly.</p>

<p>"Do you not think that in time, perhaps, you may like him
better?"</p>

<p>"No," was the blunt reply, "I do not. I told him that I
did not like him, but that I would take some time to consider<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
whether he was to be a friend of mine or not; and the conclusion
I have arrived at is, that I could not endure his friendship."</p>

<p>"When did you tell him that you did not like him?" asked
Miss Hastings, gravely.</p>

<p>"I think it was the first night he came," she replied.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings looked relieved.</p>

<p>"Did he say anything else to you, Pauline?" she asked,
gently.</p>

<p>"No; what should he say? He seemed very much surprised,
I suppose, as he says most people like him. But I do
not, and never shall."</p>

<p>One thing was certain, the captain was falling most passionately
in love with Miss Darrell. Her grand beauty, her pride,
her originality, all seemed to have an irresistible charm for him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ELINOR ROCHEFORD.</div>


<p>It was a morning in August, when a gray mist hung over the
earth, a mist that resulted from the intense heat, and through
which trees, flowers, and fountains loomed faintly like shadows.
The sun showed his bright face at intervals, but, though he withheld
his gracious presence, the heat and warmth were great; the
air was laden with perfume, and the birds were all singing as
though they knew that the sun would soon reappear.</p>

<p>One glance at her pupil's face showed Miss Hastings there
was not much to be done in the way of study. Pauline wanted
to watch the mist rise from the hills and trees. She wanted to
see the sunbeams grow bright and golden.</p>

<p>"Let us read under the lime trees, Miss Hastings," she said,
and Captain Langton smiled approval. For the time was come
when he followed her like her shadow; when he could not exist
out of her presence; when his passionate love mastered him,
and brought him, a very slave, to her feet; when the hope of
winning her was dearer to him than life itself; when he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
have sacrificed even Darrell Court for the hope of calling her his
wife.</p>

<p>If she knew of his passion, she made no sign; she never relaxed
from her haughty, careless indifference; she never tried in
the least to make herself agreeable to him.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald watched her with keen eyes, and Miss Hastings
trembled lest misfortune should come upon the girl she was
learning to love so dearly. She saw and understood that the
baronet was slowly but surely making up his mind; if Pauline
married the captain, he would make her his heiress; if not, she
would never inherit Darrell Court.</p>

<p>On this August morning they formed a pretty group under
the shadowy, graceful limes. Miss Hastings held in her hands
some of the fine fancy work which delights ladies; the captain
reclined on a tiger-skin rug on the grass, looking very handsome,
for, whatever might be his faults of mind, he was one of the
handsomest men in England. Pauline, as usual, was beautiful,
graceful, and piquant, wearing a plain morning dress of some
gray material&mdash;a dress which on any one else would have looked
plain, but which she had made picturesque and artistic by a
dash of scarlet&mdash;and a pomegranate blossom in her hair. Her
lovely face looked more than usually noble under the influence
of the words she was reading.</p>

<p>"Tennyson again!" said the captain, as she opened the book.
"It is to be regretted that the poet cannot see you, Miss Darrell,
and know how highly you appreciate his works."</p>

<p>She never smiled nor blushed at his compliments, as she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
seen other girls do. She had a fashion of fixing her bright eyes
on him, and after one glance he generally was overcome with
confusion before his compliment was ended. .</p>

<p>"I should not imagine that anything I could say would flatter
a poet," she replied, thoughtfully. "Indeed he is, I should
say, as far above blame as praise."</p>

<p>Then, without noticing him further, she went on reading.
Captain Langton's eyes never left her face; its pale, grand
beauty glowed and changed, the dark eyes grew radiant, the
beautiful lips quivered with emotion. He thought to himself
that a man might lay down his life and every hope in it to win
such love as hers.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard the sound of voices, and looking up saw
Sir Oswald escorting two ladies.</p>

<p>"What a tiresome thing!" grumbled the captain. "We can
never be alone a single hour."</p>

<p>"I thought you enjoyed society so much!" she said.</p>

<p>"I am beginning to care for no society on earth but yours,"
he whispered, his face flushing, while she turned haughtily
away.</p>

<p>"You are proud," murmured the captain to himself&mdash;"you
are as haughty as you are beautiful; but I will win you yet."</p>

<p>Then Sir Oswald, with his visitors, advanced. It was Pauline's
aversion, Lady Hampton, with her niece, Miss Rocheford.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton advanced in her usual grave, artificial manner.</p>

<p>"Sir Oswald wanted to send for you, but I said 'no.' What
can be more charming than such a group under the trees? I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
am so anxious to introduce my niece to you, Miss Darrell&mdash;she
arrived only yesterday. Elinor, let me introduce you to Miss
Darrell, Miss Hastings, and Captain Langton."</p>

<p>Pauline's dark eyes glanced at the blushing, sweet face, and
the shrinking graceful figure. Miss Hastings made her welcome;
and the captain, stroking his mustache, thought himself
in luck for knowing two such pretty girls.</p>

<p>There could not have been a greater contrast than Pauline
Darrell and Elinor Rocheford. Pauline was dark, proud, beautiful,
passionate, haughty, and willful, yet with a poet's soul
and a grand mind above all worldliness, all meanness, all artifice.
Elinor was timid, shrinking, graceful, lovely, with a delicate,
fairy-like beauty, yet withal keenly alive to the main
chance, and never forgetting her aunt's great maxim&mdash;to make
the best of everything for herself.</p>

<p>On this warm August morning Miss Rocheford wore a charming
gossamer costume of lilac and white, with the daintiest of
Parisian hats on her golden head. Her gloves, shoes, laces,
parasol, were perfection&mdash;not a fold was out of place, not a ribbon
awry&mdash;contrasting most forcibly with the grand, picturesque
girl near her.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton seated herself, and Miss Rocheford did the
same. Sir Oswald suggesting how very refreshing grapes and
peaches would be on so warm a morning, Captain Langton volunteered
to go and order some. Lady Hampton watched him
as he walked away.</p>

<p>"What a magnificent man, Sir Oswald! What a fine clever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
face! It is easy to see that he is a military man&mdash;he is so upright,
so easy; there is nothing like a military training for giving
a man an easy, dignified carriage. I think I understood that he
was the son of a very old friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"The son of the dearest friend I ever had in the world," was
the reply; "and I love him as though he were my own&mdash;indeed
I wish he were."</p>

<p>Lady Hampton sighed and looked sympathetic.</p>

<p>"Langton," she continued, in a musing tone&mdash;"is he one of
the Langtons of Orde?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Sir Oswald; "my dear old friend was of a
good family, but not greatly blessed by fortune."</p>

<p>It was wonderful to see how Lady Hampton's interest in the
captain at once died out; there was no more praise, no more
admiration for him. If she had discovered that he was heir to
an earldom, how different it would have been! Before long the
captain returned, and then a rustic table was spread under the
lime trees, with purple grapes, peaches, crimson and gold apricots,
and ruby plums.</p>

<p>"It's quite picturesque," Lady Hampton declared, with a
smile; "and Elinor, dear child, enjoys fruit so much."</p>

<p>In spite of Lady Hampton's wish, there did not appear to be
much cordiality between the two girls. Occasionally Elinor
would look at the captain, who was not slow to return her
glances with interest. His eyes said plainly that he thought her
very lovely.</p>

<p>Miss Rocheford was in every respect the model of a well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
brought up young lady. She knew that the grand end and aim
of her existence was to marry well&mdash;she never forgot that. She
was well-born, well-bred, beautiful, accomplished, but without
fortune. From her earliest girlhood Lady Hampton had impressed
upon her the duty of marrying money.</p>

<p>"You have everything else, Elinor," she was accustomed to
say. "You must marry for title and money."</p>

<p>Miss Rocheford knew it. She had no objection to her fate&mdash;she
was quite passive over it&mdash;but she did hope at times that the
man who had the title and money would be young, handsome,
and agreeable. If he were not, she could not help it, but she
hoped he would be.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton had recently become a widow. In her youth
she had felt some little hope of being mistress of Darrell Court;
but that hope had soon died. Now, however, that a niece was
thrown upon her hands, she took heart of grace in another respect;
for Sir Oswald was not an old man. It was true his hair
was white, but he was erect, dignified, and, in Lady Hampton's
opinion, more interesting than a handsome young man, who
would think of nothing but himself. If he would be but sensible,
and, instead of adopting that proud, unformed girl, marry,
how much better it would be!</p>

<p>She knew that her niece was precisely the style that he admired&mdash;elegant,
delicate, utterly incapable of any originality,
ready at any moment to yield her opinions and ideas, ready to
do implicitly as she was told, to believe in the superiority of her
husband&mdash;a model woman, in short, after Sir Oswald's own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
heart. She saw that the baronet was much struck with Elinor;
she knew that in his own mind he was contrasting the two girls&mdash;the
graceful timidity of the one, her perfect polish of manner,
with the brusque independence and terribly plain-spoken fashion
of the other.</p>

<p>"It would be ten thousand pities," said Lady Hampton to
herself, "to see that girl mistress of Darrell Court. She would
make a good queen for the Sandwich Islands. Before I go, I
must open Sir Oswald's eyes, and give him a few useful hints."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SIR OSWALD THINKS OF MARRIAGE.</div>


<p>Fortune favored Lady Hampton. Sir Oswald was so delighted
with his visitors that he insisted upon their remaining for
luncheon.</p>

<p>"The young ladies will have time to become friends," he
said; but it was well that he did not see how contemptuously
Pauline turned away at the words. "Pauline," he continued,
"Miss Rocheford will like to see the grounds. This is her first
visit to Darrell Court. Show her the fountains and the flower-gardens."</p>

<p>Elinor looked up with a well-assumed expression of rapture;
Pauline's look of annoyance indicated that she obeyed greatly
against her will.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald saw the captain looking wistfully after the two
girlish figures.</p>

<p>"Go," he said, with a courtly smile. "Young people like
to be together. I will entertain Lady Hampton."</p>

<p>Greatly relieved, the captain followed. He was so deeply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and so desperately in love that he could not endure to see Pauline
Darrell talking even to the girl by her side. He would fain
have engrossed every word, every glance of hers himself; he
was madly jealous when such were bestowed upon others.</p>

<p>The three walked down the broad cedar path together, the
captain all gallant attention, Miss Rocheford all sweetness,
Pauline haughty as a young barbaric queen bound by a conqueror's
chains. She did not like her companions, and did not
even make a feint of being civil to them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the opportunity so longed for by Lady Hampton
had arrived; and the lady seized it with alacrity. She turned to
Sir Oswald with a smile.</p>

<p>"You amuse me," she said, "by giving yourself such an air
of age. Why do you consider yourself so old, Sir Oswald? If
it were not that I feared to flatter you, I should say that there
were few young men to compare with you."</p>

<p>"My dear Lady Hampton," returned the baronet, in a voice
that was not without pathos, "look at this."</p>

<p>He placed his thin white hand upon his white hair. Lady
Hampton laughed again.</p>

<p>"What does that matter? Why, many men are gray even in
their youth. I have always wondered why you seek to appear
so old, Sir Oswald. I feel sure, judging from many indications,
that you cannot be sixty."</p>

<p>"No; but I am over fifty&mdash;and my idea is that, at fifty, one
is really old."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind!" she said, with great energy. "Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the finest men I have known were only in the prime of life
then. If you were seventy, you might think of speaking as you
do. Sir Oswald," she asked, abruptly, looking keenly at his
face, "why have you never married?"</p>

<p>He smiled, but a flush darkened the fine old face.</p>

<p>"I was in love once," he replied, simply, "and only once.
The lady was young and fair. She loved me in return. But a
few weeks before our marriage she was suddenly taken ill and
died. I have never even thought of replacing her."</p>

<p>"How sad! What sort of a lady was she, Sir Oswald&mdash;this
fair young love of yours?"</p>

<p>"Strange to say, in face, figure, and manner she somewhat
resembled your lovely young niece, Lady Hampton. She had
the same quiet, graceful manner, the same polished grace&mdash;so
different from&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From Miss Darrell," supplied the lady, promptly. "How
that unfortunate girl must jar upon you!"</p>

<p>"She does; but there are times when I have hopes of her.
We are talking like old friends now, Lady Hampton. I may
tell you that I think there is one and only one thing that can redeem
my niece, and that is love. Love works wonders sometimes,
and I have hopes that it may do so in her case. A grand
master-passion such as controls the Darrells when they love at
all&mdash;that would redeem her. It would soften that fierce pride
and hauteur, it would bring her to the ordinary level of womanhood;
it would cure her of many of the fantastic ideas that seem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to have taken possession of her; it would make her&mdash;what she
certainly is not now&mdash;a gentlewoman."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" queried Lady Hampton, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. When I look at that grand face of hers,
often so defiant, I think to myself that she may be redeemed by
love."</p>

<p>"And if this grand master-passion does not come to her&mdash;if
she cares for some one only after the ordinary fashion of women&mdash;what
then?"</p>

<p>He threw up his hands with a gesture indicative of despair.</p>

<p>"Or," continued Lady Hampton&mdash;"pray pardon me for suggesting
such a thing, Sir Oswald, but people of the world, like
you and myself, know what odd things are likely at any time to
happen&mdash;supposing that she should marry some commonplace
lover, after a commonplace fashion, and that then the master-passion
should find her out, what would be the fate of Darrell
Court?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," replied Sir Oswald, despairingly.</p>

<p>"With a person, especially a young girl, of her self-willed,
original, independent nature, one is never safe. How thankful
I am that my niece is so sweet and so womanly!"</p>

<p>Sir Oswald sat for some little time in silence. He looked on
this fair ancestral home of his, with its noble woods and magnificent
gardens. What indeed would become of it if it fell
into the ill-disciplined hands of an ill-disciplined girl&mdash;unless,
indeed, she were subject to the control of a wise husband?</p>

<p>Would Pauline ever submit to such control? Her pale,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
grand face rose before him, the haughty lips, the proud, calm
eyes&mdash;the man who mastered her, who brought her mind into
subjection, would indeed be a superior being. For the first
time a doubt crossed Sir Oswald's mind as to whether she would
ever recognize that superior being in Captain Langton. He
knew that there were depths in the girl's nature beyond his own
reach. It was not all pride, all defiance&mdash;there were genius,
poetry, originality, grandeur of intellect, and greatness of heart
before which the baronet knew that he stood in hopeless, helpless
awe.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Do not despond, old friend," she said. "I understand
you. I should feel like you. I should dread to leave the inheritance
of my fathers in such dangerous hands. But, Sir Oswald,
why despond? Why not marry?"</p>

<p>The baronet started.</p>

<p>"Marry!" he repeated. "Why, I have never thought of
such a thing."</p>

<p>"Think of it now," counseled the lady, laughingly; "you will
find the advice most excellent. Instead of tormenting yourself
about an ill-conditioned girl, who delights in defying you, you
can have an amiable, accomplished, elegant, and gentle wife to
rule your household and attend to your comfort&mdash;you might
have a son of your own to succeed you, and Darrell Court might
yet remain in the hands of the Darrells."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Lady Hampton, where should I find such a
wife? I am no longer young&mdash;who would marry me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Any sensible girl in England. Take my advice, Sir Oswald.
Let us have a Lady Darrell, and not an ill-trained girl
who will delight in setting the world at defiance. Indeed, I
consider that marriage is a duty which you owe to society and
to your race."</p>

<p>"I have never thought of it. I have always considered myself
as having, so to speak, finished with life."</p>

<p>"You have made a great mistake, but it is one that fortunately
can be remedied."</p>

<p>Lady Hampton rose from her seat, and walked a few steps
forward.</p>

<p>"I have put his thoughts in the right groove," she mused;
"but I ought to say a word about Elinor."</p>

<p>She turned to him again.</p>

<p>"You ask me who would marry you. Why, Sir Oswald, in
England there are hundreds of girls, well-bred, elegant, graceful,
gentle, like my niece, who would ask nothing better from
fortune than a husband like yourself."</p>

<p>She saw her words take effect. She had turned his thoughts
and ideas in the right direction at last.</p>

<p>"Shall we go and look after our truants?" she asked, suavely.</p>

<p>And they walked together down the path where Pauline had
so indignantly gathered the broken lily. As though unconsciously,
Lady Hampton began to speak of her niece.</p>

<p>"I have adopted Elinor entirely," she said&mdash;"indeed there
was no other course for me to pursue. Her mother was my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
youngest sister; she has been dead many years. Elinor has
been living with her father, but he has just secured a government
appointment abroad, and I asked him to give his daughter
to me."</p>

<p>"It was very kind of you," observed Sir Oswald.</p>

<p>"Nay, the kindness is on her part, not on mine. She is like
a sunbeam in my house. Fair, gentle, a perfect lady, she has
not one idea that is not in itself innately refined and delicate. I
knew that if she went into society at all she would soon marry."</p>

<p>"Is there any probability of that?" asked Sir Oswald.</p>

<p>"No, for by her own desire we shall live very quietly this
year. She wished to see Darrell Court and its owner&mdash;we have
spoken so much of you&mdash;but with that exception we shall go
nowhere."</p>

<p>"I hope she is pleased with Darrell Court," said Sir Oswald.</p>

<p>"How could she fail to be, as well as delighted with its hospitable
master? I could read that much in her pretty face.
Here they are, Sir Oswald&mdash;Miss Darrell alone, looking very
dignified&mdash;Elinor, with your friend. Ah, she knows how to
choose <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ftiends'">friends</ins>!"</p>

<p>They joined the group, but Miss Darrell was in one of her
most dignified moods. She had been forced to listen to a fashionable
conversation between Captain Langton and Miss Rocheford,
and her indignation and contempt had got the better of
her politeness.</p>

<p>They all partook of luncheon together, and then the visitors
departed; not, however, until Lady Hampton had accepted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
from Sir Oswald an invitation to spend a week at Darrell Court.
Sir Francis and Lady Allroy were coming&mdash;the party would be a
very pleasant one; and Sir Oswald said he would give a grand
ball in the course of the week&mdash;a piece of intelligence which delighted
the captain and Miss Rocheford greatly.</p>

<p>Then Lady Hampton and her niece set out. Sir Oswald held
Elinor's hand rather longer than strict etiquette required.</p>

<p>"How like she is to my dead love!" he thought, and his
adieu was more than cordial.</p>

<p>As they drove home, Lady Hampton gazed at her niece with
a look of triumph.</p>

<p>"You have a splendid chance, Elinor," she said; "no girl
ever had a better. What do you think of Darrell Court?"</p>

<p>"It is a palace, aunt&mdash;a magnificent, stately palace. I have
never seen anything like it before."</p>

<p>"It may be yours if you play your cards well, my dear."</p>

<p>"How?" cried the girl. "I thought it was to be Miss Darrell's.
Every one says she is her uncle's heiress."</p>

<p>"People need not make too sure of it. I do not think so.
With a little management, Sir Oswald will propose to you, I am
convinced."</p>

<p>The girl's face fell.</p>

<p>"But, aunt, he is so old."</p>

<p>"He is only just fifty, Elinor. No girl in her senses would
ever call that old. It is just the prime of life."</p>

<p>"I like Captain Langton so much the better," she murmured.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that you do, my dear; but there must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
no nonsense about liking or disliking. Sir Oswald's income
must be quite twenty thousand per annum, and if you manage
well, all that may be yours. But you must place yourself under
my directions, and do implicitly what I tell you, if so desirable
a result is to be achieved."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PAULINE'S LOVE FOR DARRELL COURT.</div>


<p>Miss Darrell preserved a dignified silence during dinner; but
when the servants had withdrawn, Sir Oswald, who had been
charmed with his visitors, said:</p>

<p>"I am delighted, Pauline, that you have secured a young lady
friend. You will be pleased with Miss Rocheford."</p>

<p>Pauline made no reply; and Sir Oswald, never thinking that
it was possible for one so gentle and lovely as Miss Rocheford to
meet with anything but the warmest praise, continued:</p>

<p>"I consider that Lady Hampton has done us all a great favor
in bringing her charming niece with her. Were <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'vou'">you</ins> not delighted
with her, Pauline?"</p>

<p>Miss Darrell made no haste to reply; but Sir Oswald evidently
awaited an answer.</p>

<p>"I do not like Miss Rocheford," she said at length; "it
would be quite useless to pretend that I do."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings looked up in alarm. Captain Langton leaned
back in his chair, with a smile on his lips&mdash;he always enjoyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Pauline's "scenes" when her anger was directed against any one
but himself; Sir Oswald's brow darkened.</p>

<p>"Pray, Miss Darrell, may I ask why you do not like her?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I do not like her for the same reason that I
should not like a diet of sugar. Miss Rocheford is very elegant
and gentle, but she has no opinions of her own; every wind
sways her; she has no ideas, no force of character. It is not
possible for me to really like such a person."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Pauline," interposed Miss Hastings, "you
should not express such very decided opinions; you should be
more reticent, more tolerant."</p>

<p>"If I am not to give my opinion," said Pauline, serenely,
"I should not be asked for it."</p>

<p>"Pray, Miss Hastings, do not check such delightful frankness,"
cried Sir Oswald, angrily, his hands trembling, his face
darkening with an angry frown.</p>

<p>He said no more; but the captain, who thought he saw a
chance of recommending himself to Miss Darrell's favor, observed,
later on in the evening:</p>

<p>"I knew you would not like our visitor, Miss Darrell. She
was not of the kind to attract you."</p>

<p>"Sir Oswald forced my opinion from me," she said; "but I
shall not listen to one word of disparagement of Miss Rocheford
from you, Captain Langton. You gave her great attention, you
flattered her, you paid her many compliments; and now, if you
say that you dislike her, it will simply be deceitful, and I abominate
deceit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>It was plain that Pauline had greatly annoyed Sir Oswald.
He liked Miss Rocheford very much; the sweet, yielding, gentle
disposition, which Pauline had thought so monotonous, delighted
him. Miss Rocheford was so like that lost, dead love
of his&mdash;so like! And for this girl, who tried his patience every
hour of the day, to find fault with her! It was too irritating;
he could not endure it. He was very cold and distant to Pauline
for some time, but the young girl was serenely unconscious
of it.</p>

<p>In one respect she was changing rapidly. The time had been
when she had been indifferent to Darrell Court, when she had
thought with regret of the free, happy life in the Rue d'Orme,
where she could speak lightly of the antiquity and grandeurs of
the race from which she had sprung; but all that was altered
now. It could not be otherwise, considering how romantic,
how poetical, how impressionable she was, how keenly alive to
everything beautiful and noble. She was living here in the very
cradle of the race, where every tree had its legend, every stone
its story; how could she be indifferent while the annals of her
house were filled with noble retrospects? The Darrells had
numbered great warriors and statesmen among their number.
Some of the noblest women in England had been Darrells;
and Pauline had learned to glory in the old stories, and to feel
her heart beat with pride as she remembered that she, too, was
a Darrell.</p>

<p>So, likewise, she had grown to love the Court for its picturesque<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
beauty, its stately magnificence, and the time came soon
when almost every tree and shrub was dear to her.</p>

<p>It was Pauline's nature to love deeply and passionately if she
loved at all; there was no lukewarmness about her. She was
incapable of those gentle, womanly likings that save all wear
and tear of passion. She could not love in moderation; and
very soon the love of Darrell Court became a passion with her.
She sketched the mansion from twenty different points of view,
she wrote verses about it; she lavished upon it the love which
some girls lavish upon parents, brothers, sisters, and friends.</p>

<p>She stood one day looking at it as the western sunbeams
lighted it up until it looked as though it were bathed in gold.
The stately towers and turrets, the flower-wreathed balconies,
the grand arched windows, the Gothic porch, all made up a
magnificent picture; the fountains were playing in the sunlit
air, the birds singing in the stately trees. She turned to Miss
Hastings, and the governess saw tears standing warm and bright
in the girl's eyes.</p>

<p>"How beautiful it is!" she said. "I cannot tell you&mdash;I have
no words to tell you&mdash;how I love my home."</p>

<p>The heart of the gentle lady contracted with sudden fear.</p>

<p>"It is very beautiful," she said; "but, Pauline, do not love
it too much; remember how very uncertain everything is."</p>

<p>"There can be nothing uncertain about my inheritance,"
returned the girl. "I am a Darrell&mdash;the only Darrell left to inherit
it. And, oh! Miss Hastings, how I love it! But it is
not for its wealth that I love it; it is my heart that is bound to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
it. I love it as I can fancy a husband loves his wife, a mother
her child. It is everything to me."</p>

<p>"Still," said Miss Hastings, "I would not love it too well;
everything is so uncertain."</p>

<p>"But not that," replied Pauline, quickly. "My uncle
would never dare to be so unjust as to leave Darrell Court to
any one but a Darrell. I am not in the least afraid&mdash;not in the
least."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BREACH BETWEEN UNCLE AND NIECE.</div>


<p>A few days later the tranquillity of Darrell Court was at an
end. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'She'">The</ins> invited guests were expected, and Sir Oswald had
determined to do them all honor. The state-apartments, which
had not been used during his tenure, were all thrown open;
the superb ball-room, once the pride of the county, was redecorated;
the long, empty corridors and suites of apartments reserved
for visitors, were once more full of life. Miss Hastings
was the presiding genius; Pauline Darrell took far less interest
in the preparations.</p>

<p>"I am glad," she said, one morning, "that I am to see your
'world,' Sir Oswald. You despise mine; I shall be anxious to
see what yours is like."</p>

<p>The baronet answered her testily:</p>

<p>"I do not quite understand your remarks about 'worlds.'
Surely we live under the same conditions."</p>

<p>"Not in the same world of people," she opposed; "and I
am anxious to see what yours is like."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you expect to find in what you are pleased to call
my world, Pauline?" he asked, angrily.</p>

<p>"Little truth, and plenty of affectation; little honor, and
plenty of polish; little honesty, and very high-sounding words;
little sincerity, and plenty of deceit."</p>

<p>"By what right do you sit in judgment?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"None at all," replied Pauline; "but as people are always
speaking ill of the dear, honest world in which I have lived, I
may surely be permitted to criticise the world that is outside it."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald turned away angrily; and Miss Hastings sighed
over the girl's willfulness.</p>

<p>"Why do you talk to Sir Oswald in a fashion that always irritates
him?" she remonstrated.</p>

<p>"We live in a free country, and have each of us freedom of
speech."</p>

<p>"I am afraid the day will come when you will pay a sad price
for yours."</p>

<p>But Pauline Darrell only laughed. Such fears never affected
her; she would sooner have expected to see the heavens fall at
her feet than that Sir Oswald should not leave Darrell Court to
her&mdash;his niece, a Darrell, with the Darrell face and the Darrell
figure, the true, proud features of the race. He would never
dare to do otherwise, she thought, and she would not condescend
to change either her thought or speech to please him.</p>

<p>"The Darrells do not know fear," she would say; "there
never yet was an example of a Darrell being frightened into
anything."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>So the breach between the uncle and the niece grew wider
every day. He could not understand her; the grand, untrained,
undisciplined, poetical nature was beyond him&mdash;he could
neither reach its heights nor fathom its depths. There were
times when he thought that, despite her outward coldness and
pride, there was within a soul of fire, when he dimly understood
the magnificence of the character he could not read, when he
suspected there might be some souls that could not be narrowed
or forced into a common groove. Nevertheless he feared her;
he was afraid to trust, not the honor, but the fame of his race
to her.</p>

<p>"She is capable of anything," he would repeat to himself
again and again. "She would fling the Darrell revenues to the
wind; she would transform Darrell Court into one huge observatory,
if astronomy pleased her&mdash;into one huge laboratory,
if she gave herself to chemistry. One thing is perfectly clear
to me&mdash;she can never be my heiress until she is safely married."</p>

<p>And, after great deliberation&mdash;after listening to all his heart's
pleading in favor of her grace, her beauty, her royal generosity
of character, the claim of her name and her truth&mdash;he came to
the decision that if she would marry Captain Langton, whom he
loved perhaps better than any one else in the world, he would
at once make his will, adopt her, and leave her heiress of all
that he had in the world.</p>

<p>One morning the captain confided in him, telling him how
dearly he loved his beautiful niece, and then Sir Oswald revealed
his intentions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"You understand, Aubrey," he said&mdash;"the girl is magnificently
beautiful&mdash;she is a true Darrell; but I am frightened
about her. She is not like other girls; she is wanting in tact,
in knowledge of the world, and both are essential. I hope you
will win her. I shall die content if I leave Darrell Court in
your hands, and if you are her husband. I could not pass her
over to make you my heir; but if you can persuade her to
marry you, you can take the name of Darrell, and you can guide
and direct her. What do you say, Aubrey?"</p>

<p>"What do I say?" stammered the captain. "I say this&mdash;that
I love her so dearly that I would marry her if she had not
a farthing. I love her so that language cannot express the
depth of my affection for her."</p>

<p>The captain was for a few minutes quite overcome&mdash;he had
been so long dunned for money, so hardly pressed, so desperate,
that the chance of twenty thousand a year and Darrell Court
was almost too much for him. His brow grew damp, and his
lips pale. All this might be his own if he could but win the
consent of this girl. Yet he feared her; the proud, noble face,
the grand, dark eyes rose before him, and seemed to rebuke
him for his presumptuous hope. How was he to win her?
Flattery, sweet, soft words would never do it. One scornful
look from her sent his ideas "flying right and left."</p>

<p>"If she were only like other girls," he thought, "I could
make her my wife in a few weeks."</p>

<p>Then he took heart of grace. Had he not been celebrated
for his good fortune among the fair sex? Had he not always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
found his handsome person, his low, tender voice, his pleasing
manner irresistible? Who was this proud, dark-eyed girl that
she should measure the depths of his heart and soul, and find
them wanting? Surely he must be superior to the artists in
shabby coats by whom she had been surrounded. And yet he
feared as much as he hoped.</p>

<p>"She has such a way of making me feel small," he said to
himself; "and if that kind of feeling comes over me when I
am making her an offer, it will be of no use to plead my suit."</p>

<p>But what a prospect&mdash;master of Darrell Court and twenty
thousand per annum! He would endure almost any humiliation
to obtain that position.</p>

<p>"She must have me," he said to himself&mdash;"she shall have
me! I will force her to be my wife!"</p>

<p>Why, if he could but announce his engagement to Miss Darrell,
he could borrow as much money as would clear off all his
liabilities! And how much he needed money no one knew
better than himself. He had paid this visit to the Court because
there were two writs out against him in London, and,
unless he could come to some settlement of them, he knew
what awaited him.</p>

<p>And all&mdash;fortune, happiness, wealth, freedom, prosperity&mdash;depended
on one word from the proud lips that had hardly ever
spoken kindly to him. He loved her, too&mdash;loved her with a
fierce, desperate love that at times frightened himself.</p>

<p>"I should like you," said Sir Oswald, at the conclusion of
their interview, "to have the matter settled as soon as you can;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
because, I tell you, frankly, if my niece does not consent to
marry you, I shall marry myself. All my friends are eagerly
solicitous for me to do so; they do not like the prospect of seeing
a grand old inheritance like this fall into the hands of a willful,
capricious girl. But I tell you in confidence, Aubrey, I do
not wish to marry. I am a confirmed old bachelor now, and it
would be a sad trouble to me to have my life changed by marriage.
Still I would rather marry than that harm should come
to Darrell Court."</p>

<p>"Certainly," agreed the captain.</p>

<p>"I do not mind telling you still further that I have seen a
lady whom, if I marry at all, I should like to make my wife&mdash;in
fact, she resembles some one I used to know long years ago.
I have every reason to believe she is much admired and sought
after; so that I want you to settle your affairs as speedily as possible.
Mind, Aubrey, they must be settled&mdash;there must be no
deferring, no putting off; you must have an answer&mdash;yes or no&mdash;very
shortly; and you must not lose an hour in communicating
that answer to me."</p>

<p>"I hope it will be a favorable one," said Aubrey Langton;
but his mind misgave him. He had an idea that the girl had
found him wanting; he could not forget her first frank declaration
that she did not like him.</p>

<p>"If she refuses me, have I your permission to tell Miss Darrell
the alternative?" he asked of Sir Oswald.</p>

<p>The baronet thought deeply for some minutes, and then
said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; it is only fair and just that she should know it&mdash;that
she should learn that if she refuses you she loses all chance of
being my heiress. But do not say anything of the lady I have
mentioned."</p>

<p>The visitors were coming on Tuesday, and Thursday was the
day settled for the ball.</p>

<p>"All girls like balls," thought Captain Langton. "Pauline
is sure to be in a good temper then, and I will ask her on
Thursday night."</p>

<p>But he owned to himself that he would rather a thousand
times have faced a whole battalion of enemies than ask Pauline
Darrell to be his wife.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE QUEEN OF THE BALL.</div>


<p>It was many years since Darrell Court had been so gay. Sir
Oswald had resolved that the ball should be one that should reflect
credit on the giver and the guests. He had ordered a fine
band of music and a magnificent banquet. The grounds were
to be illuminated, colored lamps being placed among the trees;
the ball-room was a gorgeous mass of brilliant bloom&mdash;tier after
tier of magnificent flowers was ranged along the walls, white
statues gleaming from the bright foliage, and little fountains
here and there sending up their fragrant spray.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald had sent to London for some one to superintend
the decorations; but they were not perfected until Miss Darrell,
passing through, suggested first one alteration, and then another,
until the originators, recognizing her superior artistic
judgment and picturesque taste, deferred to her, and then the
decorations became a magnificent work of art.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald declared himself delighted, and the captain's
praises were unmeasured. Then, and then only, Miss Darrell
began to feel some interest in the ball; her love of beauty was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
awakened and pleased&mdash;there was something more in the event
than the mere gratification of seeing people dance.</p>

<p>The expected visitors had arrived on the Tuesday&mdash;Lady
Hampton, radiant with expected victory; Elinor, silent,
thoughtful, and more gentle than ever, and consequently more
pleasing.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton was delighted with the idea of the ball.</p>

<p>"You must make a bold stroke for a husband on that evening,
Elinor," she said. "You shall have a superb dress, and I
shall quite expect you to receive and accept an offer from Sir
Oswald."</p>

<p>Elinor Rocheford raised her eyes. There was something
wistful in their expression.</p>

<p>"Oh, aunt," she said, "I like the captain so much better!"</p>

<p>Lady Hampton did not lose her good humor&mdash;Elinor was
not the first refractory girl she had brought to her senses.</p>

<p>"Never mind about liking the captain, my dear; that is only
natural. He is not in love with you. I can see through the
whole business. If Darrell Court goes to Miss Darrell, he will
marry her. He can marry no girl without money, because he
is, I know, over head and ears in debt. Major Penryn was
speaking of him to-day. The only way to prevent his marriage
with Miss Darrell is for you to take Sir Oswald yourself."</p>

<p>Elinor's face flushed.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton certainly understood the art of evoking the
worst feelings. Jealousy, envy, and dislike stirred faintly in the
gentle heart of her niece.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope you will do your very best to win Sir Oswald's affections,"
continued Lady Hampton, "for I should not like to see
Darrell Court fall into the hands of that proud girl."</p>

<p>"Nor should I," assented Miss Rocheford.</p>

<p>The evening of the ball arrived at last, and Lady Hampton
stood like a fairy godmother in Elinor's dressing-room, superintending
the toilet that was to work such wonders. Lady Hampton
herself looked very imposing in her handsome dress of
black velvet and point lace, with diamond ornaments. Elinor's
dress was a triumph of art. Her fresh, fair, gentle loveliness
shone to perfection, aided by her elaborate costume of white
silk and white lace, trimmed with green and silver leaves. The
ornaments were all of silver&mdash;both fringe and leaves; the headdress
was a green wreath with silver flowers. Nothing could
have been more elegant and effective. There was a gentle
flush on the fair face and a light in the blue eyes.</p>

<p>"That will do, Elinor," said Lady Hampton, complacently.
"Your dress is perfection. I have no fear now&mdash;you will have
no rival."</p>

<p>Perhaps Lady Hampton had never disliked Pauline Darrell
more than on that night, for the magnificent beauty of the girl
had never been so apparent. Sir Oswald had given his niece
<i>carte blanche</i> in respect to preparation for the ball, but she had
not at first taken sufficient interest in the matter to send to London,
as he wished, for a dress. Later on she had gone to the
large wardrobe, where the treasures accumulated by the Ladies
Darrell lay. Such shining treasures of satin, velvet, silk, cashmere,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and such profusion of laces and ornaments were there!
She selected a superb costume&mdash;a magnificent amber brocade,
embroidered with white flowers, gorgeous, beautiful, artistic.
It was a dress that had been made for some former Lady
Darrell.</p>

<p>How well it became her! The amber set off her dark beauty
as a golden frame does a rich picture. The dress required but
little alteration; it was cut square, showing the white, stately,
graceful neck, and the sleeves hung after the Grecian fashion,
leaving the round, white arms bare. The light shining upon
the dress changed with every movement; it was as though the
girl was enveloped in sunbeams. Every lady present envied
that dress, and pronounced it to be gorgeous beyond comparison.</p>

<p>Pauline's rich curls of dark hair were studded with diamond
stars, and a diamond necklace clasped her white throat&mdash;this
was Sir Oswald's present. Her artistic taste had found yet
further scope; for she had enhanced the beauty of her dress by
the addition of white daphnes shrouded in green leaves.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald looked at her in admiration&mdash;her magnificent
beauty, her queenly figure, her royal grace and ease of movement,
her splendid costume, all impressed him. From every
fold of her shining dress came a rich, sweet, subtle perfume;
her usually pale face had on it an unwonted flush of delicate
rose-leaf color.</p>

<p>"If she would but be like that sweet Elinor!" thought Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Oswald. "I could not wish for a more beautiful mistress for
Darrell Court."</p>

<p>She stood by his side while he received his guests, and her
dignified ease delighted him.</p>

<p>"Had she been some Eastern queen," he thought, "her
eccentricities would have hurt no one. As it is&mdash;&mdash;" and Sir
Oswald concluded his sentence by a grave shake of the head.</p>

<p>The captain, pleased with Miss Rocheford's graceful loveliness,
had been amusing himself by paying her some very choice
compliments, and she was delighted with them.</p>

<p>"If Sir Oswald were only like him!" she thought; and
Aubrey Langton, meeting the timid, gentle glance, said to himself
that he must be careful&mdash;he had no wish to win the girl's
heart&mdash;he should be quite at a loss to know what to do with it.</p>

<p>When he saw Pauline his courage almost failed him.</p>

<p>"How am I to ask that magnificent girl to marry me?" he
said.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald had expressed a wish that Aubrey and Pauline
would open the ball; it would give people an idea of what he
wished, he thought, and prevent other gentlemen from "turning
her head" by paying her any marked attention. Yet he
knew how difficult it would be for any one to win Pauline's regard.
She made no objection when he expressed his wish to
her, but she did not look particularly pleased.</p>

<p>Captain Langton understood the art of dancing better perhaps
than the art of war; he was perfect in it&mdash;even Pauline avowed
it. With him dancing was the very poetry of motion. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
flowers, the lights, the sweet, soft music, the fragrance, the silvery
sound of laughter, the fair faces and shining jewels of the
ladies, all stirred and warmed Pauline's imagination; they
brought bright and vivid fancies to her, and touched the poetical
beauty-loving soul. A glow came over her face, a light into
her proud, dark eyes, her lips were wreathed in smiles&mdash;no one
had ever seen Pauline so beautiful before.</p>

<p>"You enjoy this, do you not?" said Aubrey Langton, as he
watched her beautiful face.</p>

<p>"I shall do so," she replied, "very much indeed;" and at
what those words implied the captain's courage fell to zero.</p>

<p>He saw how many admiring eyes followed her; he knew that
all the gentlemen in the room were envying him his position
with Miss Darrell. He knew that, pretty as some of the girls
were, Pauline outshone them as the sun outshines the stars;
and he knew that she was queen of the <i>fete</i>&mdash;queen of the
ball.</p>

<p>"This is the first time you have met many of the county
people, is it not?" he asked.</p>

<p>She looked round indifferently.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is the first time," she replied.</p>

<p>"Do you admire any of the men? I know how different
your taste is from that of most girls. Is there any one here who
has pleased you?"</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," she answered; "you forget this is the first
dance. I have had no opportunity of judging."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe that I am jealous already," he observed.</p>

<p>She looked at him; her dark eyes made his heart beat, they
seemed to look through him.</p>

<p>"You are what?" she asked. "Captain Langton, I do not
understand."</p>

<p>He dared not repeat the words.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said, with a deep sigh, "that I had all the
talent and all the wealth in the world."</p>

<p>"For what reason?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Because you would care for me then."</p>

<p>"Because of your talent and wealth!" she exclaimed. "No,
that I should not."</p>

<p>"But I thought you admired talent so much," he said, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"So I do; but mere talent would never command my respect,
nor mere wealth."</p>

<p>"The two together might," he suggested.</p>

<p>"No. You would not understand me, Captain Langton,
were I to explain. Now this dance is over, and I heard you engage
Miss Rocheford for the next."</p>

<p>"And you," he said, gloomily&mdash;"what are you going to
do?"</p>

<p>"To enjoy myself," she replied; and, from the manner in
which her face brightened when he left her, the captain feared
she was pleased to be quit of him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PAULINE'S BRIGHT FANCIES.</div>


<p>The ball at Darrell Court was a brilliant success. Sir Oswald
was delighted, Lady Hampton complimented him so highly.</p>

<p>"This is just as it ought to be, Sir Oswald," she said. "One
who can give such entertainments as this should not think of
retiring from a world he is so well qualified to adorn. Confess,
now, that under the influence of that music you could dance
yourself."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald laughed.</p>

<p>"I must plead guilty," he said. "How beautiful Miss
Rocheford looks to-night!"</p>

<p>"It is well for you, Sir Oswald, that you have not heard all
the compliments that the dear child has lavished on you; they
would have made you vain."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald's face brightened with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Is your niece pleased? I am very glad indeed. It was
more to give her pleasure than from any other motive that I
gave the ball."</p>

<p>"Then you have succeeded perfectly. Now, Sir Oswald, do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
you not see that what I said was true&mdash;that an establishment
like this requires a mistress? Darrell Court always led the hospitalities
of the county. It is only since no lady has lived here
that it has fallen into the background."</p>

<p>"It shall be in the background no longer," said Sir Oswald.
"I think my first ball is a very successful one. How happy
everybody looks!"</p>

<p>But of all that brilliant company, Pauline Darrell was queen.
There were men present who would have given anything for one
smile from her lips. They admired her, they thought her beautiful
beyond comparison, but they did not feel quite at ease with
her. She was somewhat beyond them; they did not understand
her. She did not blush, and glow, and smile when they
said pretty things to her. When they gave her their most brilliant
small-talk, she had nothing to give them in return. A
soul quite different from theirs looked at them out of her dark,
proud eyes. They said to themselves that she was very beautiful,
but that she required softening, and that something lovable
and tender was wanting in her. She was a queen to be worshiped,
an empress to receive all homage, but not a woman to
be loved. So they thought who were not even capable of judging
such capacity for love as hers.</p>

<p>She was also not popular with the ladies. They thought her
very superb; they admired her magnificent dress; but they pronounced
her proud and reserved. They said she gave herself
airs, that she took no pains to make friends; and they did not
anticipate any very great rejoicings when Darrell Court should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
belong to her. The elder ladies pronounced that judgment on
her; the younger ones shrank abashed, and were slightly timid
in her presence.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald, it was noticed, led Miss Rocheford in to supper,
and seemed to pay her very great attention. Some of the ladies
made observations, but others said it was all nonsense; if Sir
Oswald had ever intended to marry, he would have married
years ago, and his choice would have fallen on a lady of mature
age, not on a slight, slender girl. Besides&mdash;and who could find
an answer to such an argument?&mdash;was it not settled that Miss
Darrell was to be his heiress? There was no doubt about
that.</p>

<p>The baronet's great affection for Aubrey Langton was also
known. More than one of the guests present guessed at the
arrangement made, and said that in all probability Miss Darrell
would marry the captain, and that they would have the Court
after Sir Oswald's death.</p>

<p>The banquet was certainly a magnificent one. The guests
did full justice to the costly wines, the rare and beautiful fruits,
the <i>recherche</i> dishes prepared with so much skill and labor.
When supper was ended, the dancers returned to the ball-room,
but Miss Darrell was already rather weary of it all.</p>

<p>She stole away during the first dance after supper. The
lamps were lighted in the conservatory, and shed a soft, pearly
light over the fragrant flowers; the great glass doors at the end
were open, and beyond lay the moonlight, soft, sweet, and silvery,
steeping the flowers, the trees, and the long grass in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
mild light. Without, all was so calm, so still; there was the
evening sky with its myriad stars, so calm and so serene; close
to the doors stood great sheaves of white lilies, and just inside
was a nest of fragrant daphnes and jessamines.</p>

<p>Pauline stood lost in delight; the perfume seemed to float in
from the moonlight and infold her. This quiet, holy, tranquil
beauty touched her heart as the splendor of the ball-room could
not; her soul grew calm and still; she seemed nearer happiness
than she had ever been before.</p>

<p>"How beautiful the world is!" she thought. She raised her
face, so serenely placid and fair in the moonlight; the silver
radiance fell upon it, adding all that was needed to make it perfect,
a blended softness and tenderness. The gorgeous, golden-hued
dress falling around her, glistened, gleamed, and glowed;
her diamonds shone like flames. No artist ever dreamed of a
fairer picture than this girl in the midst of the moonlight and
the flowers.</p>

<p>Bright fancies thronged her mind. She thought of the time
when she should be mistress of that rich domain. No mercenary
delight made her heart thrill; it was not the prospect of
being rich that delighted her; it was a nobler pride&mdash;delight in
the grand old home where heroes had lived and died, earnest
thoughts of how she would care for it, how she would love it
as some living thing when it should be her own.</p>

<p>Her own! Verily her lines were cast in pleasant places!
She dreamed great things&mdash;of the worthy deeds she would do,
of the noble charities she would carry out, the magnificent designs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
she would bring to maturity when Darrell Court should
be hers.</p>

<p>It was not that she wished for it at once. She did not love
Sir Oswald&mdash;their natures were too antagonistic for that; but
she did not wish&mdash;indeed, she was incapable of wishing&mdash;that
his life should be shortened even for one hour. She only remembered
that in the course of time this grand inheritance
must be hers. How she would help those artist-friends of her
father's! What orders she would give them, what pictures she
would buy, what encouragement she would give to art and literature!
How she would foster genius! How she would befriend
the clever and gifted poor ones of the earth!</p>

<p>The beautiful moonlight seemed to grow fairer, the blue,
starry heavens nearer, as the grand and gracious possibilities of
her life revealed themselves to her. Her heart grew warm, her
soul trembled with delight.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;then there would be something dearer and fairer
than all this&mdash;something that comes to every woman&mdash;her birthright&mdash;something
that would complete her life, that would
change it, that would make music of every word, and harmony
of every action. The time would come when love would find
her out, when the fairy prince would wake her from her magic
sleep. She was pure and spotless as the white lilies standing
near her; the breath of love had never passed over her. There
had been no long, idle conversations with young girls on the
subject of love and lovers; her heart was a blank page. But
there came to her that night, as she stood dreaming her maiden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
dreams among the flowers, an idea of how she could love, and
of what manner of man he would be who should win her love.</p>

<p>Was she like Undine? Were there depths in her heart and
soul which could not be reached until love had brought them
to light? She felt in herself great capabilities that had never
yet been exercised or called into action. Love would complete
her life; it would be the sun endowing the flowers with life,
warmth, and fragrance.</p>

<p>What manner of man must he be who would wake this soul
of hers to perfect life? She had seen no one yet capable of doing
so. The mind that mastered hers must be a master-mind;
the soul that could bring her soul into subjection must be a
grand soul, a just soul, noble and generous.</p>

<p>Ah, well, the moonlight was fair, and the flowers were fair.
Soon, perhaps, this fair dream of hers might be realized, and
then&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>&mdash;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>REJECTED.</div>


<p>A shadow came between Pauline and the moonlight, and a
quiet voice said:</p>

<p>"Miss Darrell, I am so glad to find you here, and alone!"</p>

<p>Looking up, she saw Aubrey Langton standing by her side.
Aubrey's fair, handsome face was flushed, and there was the
fragrance of the wine-cup about him, for the gallant captain's
courage had failed him, and he had to fortify himself.</p>

<p>He had seen Miss Darrell go into the conservatory, and he
understood her well enough to be sure that she had gone
thither in search of quiet. Here was his opportunity. He had
been saying to himself all day that he must watch for his opportunity.
Here it was; yet his courage failed him, and his heart
sank; he would have given anything to any one who would
have undertaken the task that lay before him. There was so
much at stake&mdash;not only love, but wealth, fortune, even freedom&mdash;there
was so much to be won or lost, that he was frightened.</p>

<p>However, as he said to himself, it had to be done. He went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
back to the dining-room and poured out for himself a tumbler
of the baronet's generous old wine, which made his heart glow,
and diffused warmth through his whole frame, and then he went
on his difficult errand. He walked quietly through the conservatory,
and saw Pauline standing at the doors.</p>

<p>He was not an artist, he had nothing of the poet about him,
but the solemn beauty of that picture did touch him&mdash;the soft,
sweet moonlight, the sheaves of white lilies, the nest of
daphnes, and that most beautiful face raised to the starry sky.</p>

<p>He stood for some minutes in silence; a dim perception of
his own unworthiness came over him. Pauline looked as
though she stood in a charmed circle, which he almost feared
to enter.</p>

<p>Then he went up to her and spoke. She was startled; she
had been so completely absorbed in her dreams, and he was the
last person on earth with whom she could identify them.</p>

<p>"I hope I have not startled you," he said. "I am so glad
to find you here, Miss Darrell. There is something I wish to
say to you."</p>

<p>Perhaps that beautiful, calm night-scene had softened her;
she turned to him with a smile more gentle than he had ever
seen on her face before.</p>

<p>"You want to tell me something&mdash;I am ready to listen, Captain
Langton. What is it?"</p>

<p>He came nearer to her. The sweet, subtle perfume from the
flowers at her breast reached him, the proud face that had
always looked proudly on him, was near his own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>He came one step nearer still, and then Pauline drew back
with a haughty gesture that seemed to scatter the light in her
jewels.</p>

<p>"I can hear perfectly well," she said, coldly. "What is it
you have to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Pauline, do not be unkind to me. Let me come nearer,
where I may kneel at your feet and pray my prayer."</p>

<p>His face flushed, his heart warmed with his words; all the
passionate love that he really felt for her woke within him.
There was no feigning, no pretense&mdash;it was all reality. It was
not Darrell Court he was thinking of, but Pauline, peerless,
queenly Pauline; and in that moment he felt that he could give
his whole life to win her.</p>

<p>"Let me pray my prayer," he repeated; "let me tell you
how dearly I love you, Pauline&mdash;so dearly and so well that if
you send me from you my life will be a burden to me, and I
shall be the most wretched of men."</p>

<p>She did not look proud of angry, but merely sorry. Her
dark eyes drooped, her lips even quivered.</p>

<p>"You love me," she rejoined&mdash;"really love me, Captain
Langton?"</p>

<p>He interrupted her.</p>

<p>"I loved you the first moment that I saw you. I have admired
others, but I have seen none like you. All the deep,
passionate love of my heart has gone out to you; and, if you
throw it from you, Pauline, I shall die."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she murmured, gently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, not sorry. Why should you be sorry? You would
not take a man's life, and hold it in the hollow of your hand,
only to fling it away. You may have richer lovers, you may
have titles and wealth offered to you, but you will never have a
love truer or deeper than mine."</p>

<p>There was a ring of truth about his words, and they haunted
her.</p>

<p>"I know I am unworthy of you. If I were a crowned king,
and you, my peerless Pauline, the humblest peasant, I should
choose you from the whole world to be my wife. But I am
only a soldier&mdash;a poor soldier. I have but one treasure, and
that I offer to you&mdash;the deepest, truest love of my heart. I
would that I were a king, and could woo you more worthily."</p>

<p>She looked up quickly&mdash;his eyes were drinking in the beauty
of her face; but there was something in them from which she
shrank without knowing why. She would have spoken, but he
went on, quickly:</p>

<p>"Only grant my prayer, Pauline&mdash;promise to be my wife&mdash;promise
to love me&mdash;and I will live only for you. I will give
you my heart, my thoughts, my life. I will take you to bright
sunny lands, and will show you all that the earth holds beautiful
and fair. You shall be my queen, and I will be your humblest
slave."</p>

<p>His voice died away in a great tearless sob&mdash;he loved her so
dearly, and there was so much at stake. She looked at him
with infinite pity in her dark eyes. He had said all that he
could think of; he had wooed her as eloquently as he was able;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
he had done his best, and now he waited for some word from
her.</p>

<p>There were tenderness, pity, and surprise in her musical voice
as she spoke to him.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry, Captain Langton. I never thought you
loved me so well. I never dreamed that you had placed all
your heart in your love."</p>

<p>"I have," he affirmed. "I have been reckless; I have
thrown heart, love, manhood, life, all at your feet together. If
you trample ruthlessly on them, Pauline, you will drive me to
desperation and despair."</p>

<p>"I do not trample on them," she said, gently; "I would not
wrong you so. I take them up in my hands and restore them
to you, thanking you for the gift."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Pauline?" he asked, while the flush
died from his face.</p>

<p>"I mean," she replied, softly, "that I thank you for the gift
you have offered me, but that I cannot accept it. I cannot be
your wife, for I do not love you."</p>

<p>He stood for some minutes dazed by the heavy blow; he had
taken hope from her gentle manner, and the disappointment
was almost greater than he could bear.</p>

<p>"It gives me as much pain to say this," she continued, "as
it gives you to hear it; pray believe that."</p>

<p>"I cannot bear it!" he cried. "I will not bear it! I will
not believe it! It is my life I ask from you, Pauline&mdash;my life!
You cannot send me from you to die in despair!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>His anguish was real, not feigned. Love, life, liberty, all
were at stake. He knelt at her feet; he covered her white,
jeweled hands with kisses and with hot, passionate tears. Her
keen womanly instinct told her there was no feigning in the
deep, broken sob that rose to his lips.</p>

<p>"It is my life!" he repeated. "If you send me from you,
Pauline, I shall be a desperate, wicked man."</p>

<p>"You should not be so," she remarked, gently; "a great
love, even if it be unfortunate, should ennoble a man, not
make him wicked."</p>

<p>"Pauline," he entreated, "you must unsay those words.
Think that you might learn to love me in time. I will be patient&mdash;I
will wait long years for you&mdash;I will do anything to win
you; only give me some hope that in time to come you will be
mine."</p>

<p>"I cannot," she said; "it would be so false. I could never
love you, Captain Langton."</p>

<p>He raised his face to hers.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me why? You do not reject me because I
am poor&mdash;you are too noble to care for wealth. It is not because
I am a soldier, with nothing to offer you but a loving
heart. It is not for these things. Why do you reject me, Pauline?"</p>

<p>"No, you are right; it is not for any of those reasons; they
would never prevent my being your wife if I loved you."</p>

<p>"Then why can you not love me?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"For many reasons. You are not at all the style of man I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
could love. How can you doubt me? Here you are wooing
me, asking me to be your wife, offering me your love, and my
hand does not tremble, my heart does not beat; your words
give me no pleasure, only pain; I am conscious of nothing but
a wish to end the interview. This is not love, is it, Captain
Langton?"</p>

<p>"But in time," he pleaded&mdash;"could you not learn to care for
me in time?"</p>

<p>"No, I am quite sure. You must not think I speak to pain
you, but indeed you are the last man living with whom I could
fall in love, or whom I could marry. If you were, as you say,
a king, and came to me with a crown to offer, it would make
no difference. It is better, as I am sure you will agree, to speak
plainly."</p>

<p>Even in the moonlight she saw how white his face had grown,
and what a sudden shadow of despair had come into his eyes.
He stood silent for some minutes.</p>

<p>"You have unmanned me," he said, slowly, "but, Pauline,
there is something else for you to hear. You must listen to me
for your own sake," he added; and then Aubrey Langton's face
flushed, his lips grew dry and hot, his breath came in short
quick gasps&mdash;he had played a manly part, but now he felt that
what he had to say would sound like a threat.</p>

<p>He did not know how to begin, and she was looking at him
with those dark, calm eyes of hers, with that new light of pity
on her face.</p>

<p>"Pauline," he said, hoarsely, "Sir Oswald wishes for this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
marriage. Oh, spare me&mdash;love me&mdash;be mine, because of the
great love I bear you!"</p>

<p>"I cannot," she returned; "in my eyes it is a crime to
marry without love. What you have to say of Sir Oswald say
quickly."</p>

<p>"But you will hate me for it," he said.</p>

<p>"No, I will not be so unjust as to blame you for Sir Oswald's
fault."</p>

<p>"He wishes us to marry; he is not only willing, but it would
give him more pleasure than anything else on earth; and he
says&mdash;do not blame me, Pauline&mdash;that if you consent he will
make you mistress of Darrell Court and all his rich revenues."</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;the pity died from her face, the proud, hard
expression came back.</p>

<p>"He must do that in any case," she said, haughtily. "I
am a Darrell; he would not dare to pass me by."</p>

<p>"Let me speak frankly to you, Pauline, for your own sake&mdash;your
own sake, dear, as well as mine. You err&mdash;he is not so
bound. Although the Darrell property has always descended
from father to son, the entail was destroyed fifty years ago, and
Sir Oswald is free to leave his property to whom he likes.
There is only one imperative condition&mdash;whoever takes it must
take with it the name of Darrell. Sir Oswald told me that
much himself."</p>

<p>"But he would not dare to pass me&mdash;a Darrell&mdash;by, and
leave it to a stranger."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but, honestly, Pauline, he told me that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
were eccentric&mdash;I know that you are adorable&mdash;and that he
would not dare to leave Darrell Court to you unless you were
married to some one in whom he felt confidence&mdash;and that
some one, Pauline, is your humble slave here, who adores you.
Listen, dear&mdash;I have not finished. He said nothing about leaving
the Court to a stranger; but he did say that unless we were
married he himself should marry."</p>

<p>She laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>"I do not believe it," she said. "If he had intended to
marry, he would have done so years ago. That is merely a
threat to frighten me; but I am not to be frightened. No Darrell
was ever a coward&mdash;I will not be coerced. Even if I liked
you, Captain Langton, I would not marry you after that threat."</p>

<p>He was growing desperate now. Great drops stood on his
brow&mdash;his lips were so hot and tremulous that he could hardly
move them.</p>

<p>"Be reasonable, Pauline. Sir Oswald meant what he said.
He will most certainly marry, and, when you see yourself deprived
of this rich inheritance, you will hate your folly&mdash;hate
and detest it."</p>

<p>"I would not purchase twenty Darrell Courts at the price of
marrying a man I do not like," she said, proudly.</p>

<p>"You think it an idle threat&mdash;it is not so. Sir Oswald
meant it in all truth. Oh, Pauline, love, riches, position,
wealth, honor&mdash;all lie before you; will you willfully reject
them?"</p>

<p>"I should consider it dishonor to marry you for the sake of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
winning Darrell Court, and I will not do it. It will be mine
without that; and, if not, I would rather a thousand times go
without it than pay the price named, and you may tell Sir Oswald
so."</p>

<p>There was no more pity&mdash;no more tenderness in the beautiful
face. It was all aglow with scorn, lighted with pride, flushed
with contempt. The spell of the sweet moonlight was broken&mdash;the
Darrell spirit was aroused&mdash;the fiery Darrell pride was all
ablaze.</p>

<p>He felt angry enough to leave her at that moment and never
look upon her again; but his position was so terrible, and he
had so much at stake. He humbled himself again and again&mdash;he
entreated her in such wild, passionate tones as must have
touched one less proud.</p>

<p>"I am a desperate man, Pauline," he cried, at last; "and I
pray you, for Heaven's sake, do not drive me to despair."</p>

<p>But no words of his had power to move her; there was nothing
but scorn in the beautiful face, nothing but scorn in the
willful, passionate heart.</p>

<p>"Sir Oswald should have known better than to use threats to
a Darrell!" she said, with a flash of her dark eyes; and not the
least impression could Aubrey Langton make upon her.</p>

<p>He was silent at last in sheer despair. It was all over; he
had no more hope. Life had never held such a brilliant chance
for any man, and now it was utterly lost. Instead of wealth,
luxury, happiness, there was nothing before him but disgrace.
He could almost have cursed her as she stood there in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
moonlight before him. A deep groan, one of utter, uncontrollable
anguish escaped his lips. She went nearer to him and
started back in wonder at the white, settled despair on his face.</p>

<p>"Captain Langton," she said, quietly, "I am sorry&mdash;I am
sorry&mdash;I am indeed sorry&mdash;that you feel this so keenly. Let
me comfort you."</p>

<p>He appealed to her again more passionately than ever, but
she interrupted him.</p>

<p>"You mistake me," she said; "I am grieved to see you
suffer, but I have no thought of altering my mind. Let me tell
you, once and for all, I would rather die than marry you, because
I have neither liking nor respect for you; but your sorrow
I cannot but feel for."</p>

<p>"You have ruined me," he said, bitterly, "and the curse of
a broken-hearted man will rest upon you!"</p>

<p>"I do not think the Darrells are much frightened at curses,"
she retorted; and then, in all the magnificence of her shining
gems and golden-hued dress, she swept from the spot.</p>

<p>Yes, he was ruined, desperate. Half an hour since, entering
that conservatory, he had wondered whether he should leave it a
happy, prosperous man. He knew now that there was nothing
but blank, awful despair, ruin and shame, before him. He had
lost her, too, and love and hate fought fiercely in his heart.
He buried his face in his hands and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>A ruined man! Was ever so splendid a chance lost? It
drove him mad to think of it! All was due to the willful
caprice of a willful girl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he remembered that time was passing, and that he must
tell Sir Oswald that he had failed&mdash;utterly, ignominiously failed.
He went back to the ball-room and saw the baronet standing in
the center of a group of gentlemen. He looked anxiously at
the captain, and at his approach the little group fell back, leaving
them alone.</p>

<p>"What news, Aubrey?" asked Sir Oswald.</p>

<p>"The worst that I can possibly bring. She would not even
hear of it."</p>

<p>"And you think there is no hope either now or at any future
time?"</p>

<p>"I am, unfortunately, sure of it. She told me in plain
words that she would rather die than marry me, and she laughed
at your threats."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald's face flushed; he turned away haughtily.</p>

<p>"The consequence be on her own head!" he said, as he
moved away. "I shall make Elinor Rocheford an offer to-night,"
he added to himself.</p>

<p>The captain was in no mood for dancing; the music and
light had lost all their charms. The strains of a beautiful German
waltz filled the ball-room. Looking round, he saw Pauline
Darrell, in all the sheen of her jewels and the splendor of
her golden-hued dress, waltzing with Lord Lorrimer. Her
beautiful face was radiant; she had evidently forgotten all about
him and the threat that was to disinherit her.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald saw her too as he was searching for Elinor&mdash;saw
her radiant, triumphant, and queenly&mdash;and almost hated her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
for the grand dower of loveliness that would never now enhance
the grandeur of the Darrells. He found Elinor Rocheford with
Lady Hampton. She had been hoping that the captain would
ask her to dance again. She looked toward him with a feint
smile, but was recalled to order by a gesture from Lady
Hampton.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald, with a low bow, asked if Miss Rocheford would
like a promenade through the rooms. She would fain have
said "No," but one look from her aunt was sufficient. She
rose in her quiet, graceful way, and accompanied him.</p>

<p>They walked to what was called the white drawing-room,
and there, standing before a magnificent Murillo, the gem of
the Darrell collection, Sir Oswald Darrell made Elinor Rocheford
a quiet offer of his hand and fortune.</p>

<p>Just as quietly she accepted it; there was no blushing, no
trembling, no shrinking. He asked her to be Lady Darrell,
and she consented. There was very little said of love, although
his wooing was chivalrous and deferential. He had secured his
object&mdash;won a fair young wife for himself, and punished the
proud, defiant, willful girl who had laughed at his threats.
After some little time he led his fair companion back to Lady
Hampton.</p>

<p>"Miss Rocheford has done me very great honor," he said;
"she has consented to be my wife. I will give myself the
pleasure of waiting upon you to-morrow, Lady Hampton, when
I shall venture to ask for a happy and speedy conclusion to my
suit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Hampton, with a gentle movement of her fan, intended
to express emotion, murmured a few words, and the interview
was ended.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Elinor," she said. "You have secured
a splendid position; no girl in England could have done
better."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Elinor Rocheford, "I ought to be ticketed,
'Sold to advantage;'" and that was the only bitter thing the
young girl ever said of her brilliant marriage.</p>

<p>Of course Lady Hampton told the delightful news to a few
of her dearest friends; and these, watching Pauline Darrell
that night in the splendor of her grand young beauty, the
sheen of her jewels, and the glitter of her rich amber dress,
knew that her reign was ended, her chance of the inheritance
gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PAULINE THREATENS VENGEANCE.</div>


<p>"Pray do not leave us, Miss Hastings; I wish you to hear
what I have to say to my niece, if you will consent to remain;"
and Sir Oswald placed a chair for the gentle, amiable lady, who
was so fearful of coming harm to her willful pupil.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings took it, and looked apprehensively at the
baronet. It was the morning after the ball, and Sir Oswald had
sent to request the presence of both ladies in the library.</p>

<p>Pauline looked fresh and brilliant; fatigue had not affected
her. She had taken more pains than usual with her toilet;
her dress was a plain yet handsome morning costume. There
was no trace of fear on her countenance; the threats of the
previous night had made no impression upon her. She looked
calmly at Sir Oswald's flushed, agitated face.</p>

<p>"Pray be seated, Miss Darrell," he said; "it is you especially
whom I wish to see."</p>

<p>Pauline took a chair and looked at him with an air of great
attention. Sir Oswald turned the diamond ring on his finger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Am I to understand, Miss Darrell," he asked, "that you
refused Captain Langton last evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, distinctly.</p>

<p>"Will you permit me to ask why?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Because I do not love him, Sir Oswald. I may even go
further, and say I do not respect him."</p>

<p>"Yet he is a gentleman by birth and education, handsome,
most agreeable in manner, devoted to you, and my friend."</p>

<p>"I do not love him," she said again; "and the Darrells are
too true a race to marry without love."</p>

<p>The allusion to his race pleased the baronet, in spite of his
anger.</p>

<p>"Did Captain Langton give you to understand the alternative?"
asked Sir Oswald. "Did he tell you my resolve in case
you should refuse him?"</p>

<p>She laughed a clear, ringing laugh, in which there was a slight
tinge of mockery. Slight though it was, Sir Oswald's face
flushed hotly as he heard it.</p>

<p>"He told me that you would disinherit me if I did not marry
him; but I told him you would never ignore the claim of the
last living Darrell&mdash;you would not pass me over and make a
stranger your heir."</p>

<p>"But did he tell you my intentions if you refused him?"</p>

<p>Again came the musical laugh that seemed to irritate Sir Oswald
so greatly.</p>

<p>"He talked some nonsense about your marrying," said Pauline:
"but that of course I did not believe."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"And why did you not believe it, Miss Darrell?"</p>

<p>"Because I thought if you had wished to marry you would
have married before this," she replied.</p>

<p>"And you think," he said, his face pale with passion, "that
you may do as you like&mdash;that your contempt for all proper
laws, your willful caprice, your unendurable pride, are to rule
every one? You are mistaken, Miss Darrell. If you had consented
to marry Aubrey Langton, I would have made you my
heiress, because I should have known that you were in safe
hands, under proper guidance; as it is&mdash;as you have refused in
every instance to obey me, as you have persisted in ignoring
every wish of mine&mdash;it is time we came to a proper understanding.
I beg to announce to you the fact that I am engaged to
be married&mdash;that I have offered my hand and heart to a lady
who is as gentle as you are the reverse."</p>

<p>A dread silence followed the words; Pauline bore the blow
like a true Darrell, never flinching, never showing the least dismay.
After a time she raised her dark, proud eyes to his face.</p>

<p>"If your marriage is for your happiness, I wish you joy,"
she said, simply.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt but that it will add greatly to my happiness,"
he put in, shortly.</p>

<p>"At the same time," resumed Pauline, "I must tell you
frankly that I do not think you have used me well. You told
me when I came here that I was to be heiress of Darrell Court.
I have grown to love it, I have shaped my life in accordance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
with what you said to me, and I do not think it fair that you
should change your intentions."</p>

<p>"You have persistently defied me," returned the baronet;
"you have preferred your least caprice to my wish; and now
you must reap your reward. Had you been dutiful, obedient,
submissive, you might have made yourself very dear to me.
Pray, listen." He raised his fine white hand with a gesture that
demanded silence. "My marriage need not make any difference
as regards your residence here. As you say, you are a
Darrell, and my niece, so your home is here; and, unless you
make yourself intolerable, you shall always have a home suitable
to your position. But, as I can never hope that you will
prove an agreeable companion to the lady who honors me by
becoming my wife, I should be grateful to Miss Hastings if she
would remain with you."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings bowed her head; she was too deeply grieved
for words.</p>

<p>"It is my wish that you retain your present suite of rooms,"
continued Sir Oswald; "and Lady Darrell, when she comes,
will, I am sure, try to make everything pleasant for you. I
have no more to say. As for expressing any regret for the part
you have acted toward my young friend, Aubrey Langton, it is
useless&mdash;we will let the matter drop."</p>

<p>All the Darrell pride and passion had been slowly gathering
in Pauline's heart; a torrent of burning words rose to her lips.</p>

<p>"If you wish to marry, Sir Oswald," she said, "you have a
perfect right to do so&mdash;no one can gainsay that; but I say you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
have acted neither justly nor fairly to me. As for the stranger
you would bring to rule over me, I shall hate her, and I will be
revenged on her. I shall tell her that she is taking my place;
I shall speak my mind openly to her; and, if she chooses to
marry you, to help you to punish me, she shall take the consequences."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald laughed.</p>

<p>"I might be alarmed by such a melodramatic outburst," he
said, "but that I know you are quite powerless;" and with a
profound bow to Miss Hastings, Sir Oswald quitted the library.</p>

<p>Then Pauline's anger burst forth; she grew white with rage.</p>

<p>"I have not been fairly used," she cried. "He told me
Darrell Court was to be mine. My heart has grown to love it;
I love it better than I love anything living."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings, like a sensible woman, refrained from saying
anything on the subject&mdash;from reminding her that she had been
warned time after time, and had only laughed at the warning.
She tried to offer some soothing words, but the girl would not
listen to them. Her heart and soul were in angry revolt.</p>

<p>"I might have been a useful woman," she said, suddenly,
"if I had had this chance in life; I might have been happy myself,
and have made others happy. As it is, I swear that I will
live only for vengeance."</p>

<p>She raised her beautiful white arm and jeweled hand.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," she said; "I will live for vengeance&mdash;not
on Sir Oswald&mdash;if he chooses to marry, let him&mdash;but I will first
warn the woman he marries, and then, if she likes to come here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
as Lady Darrell, despite my warning, let her. I will take such
vengeance on her as suits a Darrell&mdash;nothing commonplace&mdash;nothing
in the way of poisoning&mdash;but such revenge as shall
satisfy even me."</p>

<p>In vain Miss Hastings tried to soothe her, to calm her, the
torrent of angry words had their way.</p>

<p>Then she came over to Miss Hastings, and, placing her hand
on her shoulder, asked:</p>

<p>"Tell me, whom do you think Sir Oswald is going to
marry?"</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine&mdash;unless it is Miss Rocheford."</p>

<p>"Elinor Rocheford&mdash;that mere child! Let her beware!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CAPTAIN LANGTON DESPERATE.</div>


<p>A short period of calm fell upon Darrell Court. Miss Darrell's
passion seemed to have exhausted itself.</p>

<p>"I will never believe," she said one day to Miss Hastings,
"that Sir Oswald meant what he said. I am beginning to
think it was merely a threat&mdash;the Darrells are all hot-tempered."</p>

<p>But Miss Hastings had heard more than she liked to tell her
pupil, and she knew that what the baronet had said was not
only quite true, but that preparations for the marriage had actually
commenced.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it was no threat, Pauline," she said, sadly.</p>

<p>"Then let the new-comer beware," said the girl, her face darkening.
"Whoever she may be, let her beware. I might have
been a good woman, but this will make me a wicked one. I
shall live only for revenge."</p>

<p>A change came over her. The improvement that Miss Hastings
had so fondly noticed, and of which she had been so proud,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
died away. Pauline seemed no longer to take any interest in
reading or study. She would sit for hours in gloomy, sullen
silence, with an abstracted look on her face. What was passing
in her mind no one knew. Miss Hastings would go to her,
and try to rouse her; but Pauline grew impatient.</p>

<p>"Do leave me in peace," she would say. "Leave me to my
own thoughts. I am framing my plans."</p>

<p>And the smile that came with the words filled poor Miss
Hastings with terrible apprehensions as to the future of her
strange, willful pupil.</p>

<p>The captain was still at the Court. He had had some vague
idea of rushing off to London; but a letter from one of his
most intimate friends warned him to keep out of the way until
some arrangement could be made about his affairs. More than
one angry creditor was waiting for him; indeed, the gallant captain
had brought his affairs to such a pass that his appearance
in London without either money or the hope of it would have
been highly dangerous.</p>

<p>He was desperate. Sir Oswald had hinted to him, since the
failure of their plan, that he should not be forgotten in his will.
He would have borrowed money from him but for that hint;
but he did not care to risk the loss of many thousand pounds
for the sake of fifteen hundred.</p>

<p>Fifteen hundred&mdash;that was all he wanted. If he could have
gone back to London the betrothed husband of Pauline Darrell,
he could have borrowed as many thousands; but that chance
was gone; and he could have cursed the girlish caprice that deprived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
him of so splendid a fortune. In his heart fierce love
and fierce hate warred together; there were times when he felt
that he loved Pauline with a passion words could not describe;
and at other times he hated her with something passing common
hate. They spoke but little; Miss Darrell spent as much
time as possible in her own rooms. Altogether the domestic
atmosphere at Darrell Court had in it no sunshine; it was
rather the brooding, sullen calm that comes before a storm.</p>

<p>The day came when the Court was invaded by an army of
workmen, when a suit of rooms was fitted up in the most
superb style, and people began to talk of the coming change.
Pauline Darrell kept so entirely aloof from all gossip, from all
friends and visitors, that she was the last to hear on whom Sir
Oswald's choice had fallen. But one day the baronet gave a
dinner-party at which the ladies of the house were present, and
there was no mistaking the allusions made.</p>

<p>Pauline Darrell's face grew dark as she listened. So, then,
the threat was to be carried out, and the grand old place that
she had learned to love with the deepest love of her heart was
never to be hers! She gave no sign; the proud face was very
pale, and the dark eyes had in them a scornful gleam, but no
word passed her lips.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald was radiant, he had never been seen in such high
spirits; his friends had congratulated him, every one seemed to
approve so highly of his resolution; a fair and gentle wife was
ready for him&mdash;one so fair and gentle that it seemed to the old
man as though the lost love of his youth had returned to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Who remembered the bitter, gnawing disappointment of the girl
who had cared so little about making herself friends?</p>

<p>The baronet was so delighted, and everything seemed so
bright and smiling, that he resolved upon an act of unusual
generosity. His guests went away early, and he retired to the
library for a few minutes. The captain followed the ladies to
the drawing-room, and, while pretending to read, sat watching
Pauline's face, and wondering how he was to pay his debts.</p>

<p>To ask for the loan of fifteen hundred pounds would be to
expose his affairs to Sir Oswald. He must confess then that he
had gambled on the turf and at play. If once the stately old
baronet even suspected such a thing, there was no further hope
of a legacy&mdash;the captain was quite sure of that. His anxiety
was terrible, and it was all occasioned by that proud, willful girl
whose beautiful face was turned resolutely from him.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald entered the room with a smile on his face, and,
going up to Aubrey Langton, slipped a folded paper into his
hands.</p>

<p>"Not a word of thanks," he said; "if you thank me, I shall
be offended."</p>

<p>And Aubrey, opening the paper, found that it was a check
for five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>"I know what life in London costs," said Sir Oswald; "and
you are my old friend's son."</p>

<p>Five hundred pounds! He was compelled to look exceedingly
grateful, but it was difficult. The gift was very welcome,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
but there was this great drawback attending it&mdash;it was not half
sufficient to relieve him from his embarrassments, and it would
quite prevent his asking Sir Oswald for a loan. He sighed
deeply in his dire perplexity.</p>

<p>Still smiling, the baronet went to the table where Pauline and
Miss Hastings sat. He stood for some minutes looking at
them.</p>

<p>"I must not let you hear the news of my good fortune from
strangers," he said; "it is only due to you that I should inform
you that in one month from to-day I hope to have the honor
and happiness of making Miss Elinor Rocheford my wife."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings in a few cautious words wished him joy; Pauline's
white lips opened, but no sound escaped them. Sir Oswald
remained for some minutes talking to Miss Hastings, and
then he crossed the room and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Pauline, my dearest child!" whispered the anxious governess.</p>

<p>Miss Darrell looked at her with a terrible smile.</p>

<p>"It would have been better for her," she said, slowly, "that
she had never been born."</p>

<p>"Pauline!" cried the governess. But she said no more.</p>

<p>A footman entered the room, to whom Sir Oswald spoke.</p>

<p>"Go to my study," he said, "and bring me a black ebony
box that you will find locked in my writing-table. Here are
the keys."</p>

<p>The man returned in a few minutes, bearing the box in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
hands. Sir Oswald took it to the table where the lamps shone
brightly.</p>

<p>"Aubrey," he said, "will you come here? I have a commission
for you."</p>

<p>Captain Langton followed him to the table, and some remark
about the fashion of the box drew the attention of all present
to it. Sir Oswald raised the lid, and produced a diamond ring.</p>

<p>"You are going over to Audleigh Royal to-morrow, Aubrey,"
he said; "will you leave this with Stamford, the jeweler? I
have chosen a new setting for the stone. I wish to present it to
Miss Hastings as a mark of my deep gratitude to her."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings looked up in grateful wonder. Sir Oswald
went on talking about the contents of the ebony box. He
showed them many quaint treasures that it contained; among
other things he took out a roll of bank-notes.</p>

<p>"That is not a very safe method of keeping money, Sir Oswald,"
said Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>"No, you are right," he agreed. "Simpson's clerk paid it
to me the other day; I was busy, and I put it there until I had
time to take the numbers of the notes."</p>

<p>"Do you keep notes without preserving a memorandum of
their numbers, Sir Oswald?" inquired Aubrey Langton. "That
seems to me a great risk."</p>

<p>"I know it is not prudent; but there is no fear. I have
none but honest and faithful servants about me. I will take the
numbers and send the notes to the bank to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Hastings, quietly, "it is better to keep
temptation from servants."</p>

<p>"There is no fear," he returned. "I always put the box
away, and I sleep with my keys under my pillow."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald gave Captain Langton a few directions about the
diamond, and then the ladies withdrew.</p>

<p>"Sir Oswald," said Captain Langton, "let me have a cigar
with you to-night. I must not thank you, but if you knew
how grateful I feel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will put away the box first, and then we will have a glass
of wine, Aubrey."</p>

<p>The baronet went to his study, and the captain to his room;
but in a few minutes they met again, and Sir Oswald ordered a
bottle of his choicest Madeira. They sat talking for some
time, and Sir Oswald told Aubrey all his plans&mdash;all that he intended
to do. The young man listened, with envy and dissatisfaction
burning in his heart. All these plans, these hopes,
these prospects, might have been his but for that girl's cruel
caprice.</p>

<p>They talked for more than an hour; and then Sir Oswald
complained of feeling sleepy.</p>

<p>"The wine does not seem to have its usual flavor to-night,"
he said; "there is <i>something wrong</i> with this bottle."</p>

<p>"I thought the same thing," observed Aubrey Langton;
"but I did not like to say so. I will bid you good-night, as
you are tired. I shall ride over to Audleigh Royal early in the
morning, so I may not be here for breakfast."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>They shook hands and parted, Sir Oswald murmuring something
about his Madeira, and the captain feeling more desperate
than ever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MYSTERIOUS ROBBERY.</div>


<p>The sun shone on Darrell Court; the warmth and brightness
of the day were more than pleasant. The sunbeams fell on the
stately trees, the brilliant flowers. There was deep silence in
the mansion. Captain Langton had been gone some hours.
Sir Oswald was in his study. Pauline sat with Miss Hastings
under the shade of the cedar on the lawn. She had a book in
her hands, but she had not turned a page. Miss Hastings
would fain have said something to her about inattention, but
there was a look in the girl's face that frightened her&mdash;a proud,
hard, cold look that she had never seen there before.</p>

<p>Pauline Darrell was not herself that morning. Miss Hastings
had told her so several times. She had asked her again
and again if she was ill&mdash;if she was tired&mdash;and she had answered
drearily, "No." Partly to cheer her, the governess had suggested
that they should take their books under the shade of the
cedar tree. She had assented wearily, without one gleam of
animation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Out there in the sunlight Miss Hastings noticed how cold
and white Pauline's face was, with its hard, set look&mdash;there was
a shadow in the dark eyes, and, unlike herself, she started at
every sound. Miss Hastings watched her keenly. She evinced
no displeasure at being so watched; but when the elder lady
went up to her and said, gently:</p>

<p>"Pauline, you are surely either ill or unhappy?"</p>

<p>"I am neither&mdash;I am only thinking," she returned, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Then your thoughts must be very unpleasant ones&mdash;tell
them to me. Nothing sends away unpleasant ideas so soon as
communicating them to others."</p>

<p>But Miss Darrell had evidently not heard the words; she had
relapsed into deep meditation, and Miss Hastings thought it
better to leave her alone. Suddenly Pauline looked up.</p>

<p>"Miss Hastings," she said, "I suppose a solemn promise,
solemnly given, can never be broken?"</p>

<p>"It never should be broken," replied the governess. "Instances
have been known where people have preferred death to
breaking such a promise."</p>

<p>"Yes, such deaths have been known. I should imagine,"
commented Pauline, with a gleam of light on her face, "that
no Darrell ever broke his or her word when it had been solemnly
given."</p>

<p>"I should imagine not," said Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>But she had no clew to her pupil's musings or to the reason
of her question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>So the noon-day shadows crept on. Purple-winged butterflies
coquetted with the flowers, resting on the golden breasts of
the white lilies, and on the crimson leaves of the rose; busy
bees murmured over the rich clove carnations; the birds sang
sweet, jubilant songs, and a gentle breeze stirred faintly the
leaves on the trees. For once Pauline Darrell seemed blind to
the warm, sweet summer beauty; it lay unheeded before her.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings saw Sir Oswald coming toward them; a murmur
of surprise came from her lips.</p>

<p>"Pauline," she said, "look at Sir Oswald&mdash;how ill he seems.
I am afraid something is wrong."</p>

<p>He drew near to them, evidently deeply agitated.</p>

<p>"I am glad to find you here, Miss Hastings," he said; "I
am in trouble. Nay, Pauline, do not go; my troubles should
be yours."</p>

<p>For the girl had risen with an air of proud weariness, intending
to leave them together. At his words&mdash;the kindest he had
spoken to her for some time&mdash;she took her seat again; but the
haughty, listless manner did not change.</p>

<p>"I am nearly sixty years of age," said Sir Oswald, "and
this is the first time such a trouble has come to me. Miss
Hastings, do you remember that conversation of ours last night,
over that roll of notes in the ebony box?"</p>

<p>"I remember it perfectly, Sir Oswald."</p>

<p>"I went this morning to take them from the box, to take
their numbers and send them to the bank, and I could not find
them&mdash;they were gone."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gone!" repeated Miss Hastings. "It is impossible! You
must be mistaken; you must have overlooked them. What
did they amount to?"</p>

<p>"Exactly one thousand pounds," he replied. "I cannot
understand it. You saw me replace the notes in the box?"</p>

<p>"I did; I watched you. You placed them in one corner.
I could put my finger on the place," said Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>"I locked the box and carried it with my own hands to my
study. I placed it in the drawer of my writing-table, and locked
that. I never parted with my keys to any one; as is my invariable
rule, I placed them under my pillow. I slept soundly all
night, and when I woke I found them there. As I tell you I
have been to the box, and the notes are gone. I cannot understand
it, for I do not see any indication of a theft, and yet I
have been robbed."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings looked very thoughtful.</p>

<p>"You have certainly been robbed," she said. "Are you
sure the keys have never left your possession?"</p>

<p>"Never for one single moment," he replied.</p>

<p>"Has any one in the house duplicate keys?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No. I bought the box years ago in Venice; it has a peculiar
lock&mdash;there is not one in England like it."</p>

<p>"It is very strange," said Miss Hastings. "A thousand
pounds is no trifle to lose."</p>

<p>Pauline Darrell, her face turned to the flowers, uttered no
word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might show some little interest, Pauline," said her
uncle, sharply; "you might have the grace to affect it, even if
you do not feel it."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry indeed," she returned, coldly. "I am
grieved that you have had such a loss."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald looked pacified.</p>

<p>"It is not so much the actual loss of the money that has
grieved me," he said; "I shall not feel it. But I am distressed
to think that there should be a thief among the people I have
loved and trusted."</p>

<p>"What a solemn council!" interrupted the cheery voice of
Aubrey Langton. "What gloomy conspirators!"</p>

<p>Sir Oswald looked up with an air of great relief.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you are come, Aubrey; you can advise me
what to do."</p>

<p>And the baronet told the story of his loss.</p>

<p>Captain Langton was shocked, amazed; he asked a hundred
questions, and then suggested that they should drive over to
Audleigh Royal and place the affair in the hands of the chief
inspector of police.</p>

<p>"You said you had not taken the numbers of the notes; I
fear it will be difficult to trace them," he said, regretfully.
"What a strange, mysterious robbery. Is there any one you
suspect, Sir Oswald?"</p>

<p>No; in all the wide world there was not one that the loyal
old man suspected of robbing him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"My servants have always been to me like faithful old
friends," he said, sadly; "there is not one among them who
would hold out his hand to steal from me."</p>

<p>Captain Langton suggested that, before going to Audleigh
Royal, they should search the library.</p>

<p>"You may have made some mistake, sir," he said. "You
were tired last night, and it is just possible that you may have
put the money somewhere else, and do not remember it."</p>

<p>"We will go at once," decided Sir Oswald.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings wished them success; but the proud face
directed toward the flowers was never turned to them. The
pale lips were never unclosed to utter one word.</p>

<p>After the gentlemen had left them, when Miss Hastings began
to speak eagerly of the loss, Pauline raised her hand with a
proud gesture.</p>

<p>"I have heard enough," she said. "I do not wish to hear
one word more."</p>

<p>The robbery created a great sensation; inspectors came from
Audleigh Royal, and a detective from Scotland Yard, but no
one could throw the least light upon the subject. The notes
could not be traced; they had been paid in from different
sources, and no one had kept a list of the numbers.</p>

<p>Even the detective seemed puzzled. Sir Oswald had locked
up the notes in the box at night, he had kept the keys in his
own possession, and he had found in the morning that the box
was still locked and the notes were gone. It was a nine days'
wonder. Captain Langton gave all the help he could, but as all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
search seemed useless and hopeless, it was abandoned after a
time, and at the end of the week Captain Langton was summoned
to London, and all hope of solving the mystery was relinquished.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FULFILLING THE CONTRACT.</div>


<p>The preparations for the wedding went on with great activity;
the rooms prepared for the bride were a marvel of luxury and
beauty. There was a boudoir with rose-silk and white-lace
hangings, adorned with most exquisite pictures and statues,
with rarest flowers and most beautiful ornaments&mdash;a little fairy
nook, over which every one went into raptures except Pauline;
she never even looked at the alterations, she never mentioned
them nor showed the least interest in them. She went on in
her cold, proud, self-contained manner, hiding many thoughts
in her heart.</p>

<p>"Miss Hastings," she said, one morning, "you can do me a
favor. Sir Oswald has been saying that we must call at the
Elms to see Lady Hampton and Miss Rocheford. I should refuse,
but that the request exactly suits my plans. I wish to see
Miss Rocheford; we will drive over this afternoon. Will you
engage Lady Hampton in conversation while I talk to her
niece?"</p>

<p>"I will do anything you wish, Pauline," returned Miss Hastings;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
"but, my dear child, be prudent. I am frightened for
you&mdash;be prudent. It will be worse than useless for you to
make an enemy of the future Lady Darrell. I would do anything
to help you, anything to shield you from sorrow or harm,
but I am frightened on your account."</p>

<p>Caresses and demonstrations of affection were very rare with
Pauline; but now she bent down with a softened face and kissed
the anxious brow.</p>

<p>"You are very good to me," she said. "You are the only
one in the wide world who cares for me."</p>

<p>And with the words there came to her such a sense of loneliness
and desolation as no language could describe. Of what
use had been her beauty, of which her poor father had been so
proud&mdash;of what avail the genius with which she was so richly
dowered?</p>

<p>No one loved her. The only creature living who seemed to
enter into either her joys or her sorrows was the kind-hearted,
gentle governess.</p>

<p>"You must let me have my own way this time, Miss Hastings.
One peculiarity of the Darrells is that they must say
what is on their minds. I intend to do so now; it rests with
you whether I do it in peace or not."</p>

<p>After that Miss Hastings knew all further remonstrance was
useless. She made such arrangements as Pauline wished, and
that afternoon they drove over to the Elms. Lady Hampton
received them very kindly; the great end and aim of her life
was accomplished&mdash;her niece was to be Lady Darrell, of Darrell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Court. There was no need for any more envy or jealousy of
Pauline. The girl who had so lately been a dangerous rival
and an enemy to be dreaded had suddenly sunk into complete
insignificance. Lady Hampton even thought it better to be
gracious, conciliatory, and kind; as Elinor had to live with
Miss Darrell, it was useless to make things disagreeable.</p>

<p>So Lady Hampton received them kindly. Fruit from the
Court hothouses and flowers from the Court conservatories were
on the table. Lady Hampton insisted that Miss Hastings
should join her in her afternoon tea, while Pauline, speaking
with haughty grace, expressed a desire to see the Elms garden.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton was not sorry to have an hour's gossip with
Miss Hastings, and she desired Elinor to show Miss Darrell all
their choicest flowers.</p>

<p>Elinor looked half-frightened at the task. It was wonderful
to see the contrast that the two girls presented&mdash;Pauline tall,
slender, queenly, in her sweeping black dress, all passion and
magnificence; Miss Rocheford, fair, dainty, golden-haired, and
gentle.</p>

<p>They walked in silence down one of the garden-paths, and
then Miss Rocheford said, in her low, sweet voice:</p>

<p>"If you like roses, Miss Darrell, I can show you a beautiful
collection."</p>

<p>Then for the first time Pauline's dark eyes were directed toward
her companion's face.</p>

<p>"I am a bad dissembler, Miss Rocheford," she said, proudly.
"I have no wish to see your flowers. I came here to see you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
There is a seat under yonder tree. Come with me, and hear
what I have to say."</p>

<p>Elinor followed, looking and feeling terribly frightened.
What had this grand, imperious Miss Darrell to say to her?
They sat down side by side under the shade of a large magnolia
tree, the white blossoms of which filled the air with sweetest
perfume; the smiling summer beauty rested on the landscape.
They sat in silence for some minutes, and then Pauline turned
to Elinor.</p>

<p>"Miss Rocheford," she said, "I am come to give you a
warning&mdash;the most solemn warning you have ever received&mdash;one
that if you have any common sense you will not refuse to
heed. I hear that you are going to marry my uncle, Sir Oswald.
Is it true?"</p>

<p>"Sir Oswald has asked me to be his wife," Elinor replied,
with downcast eyes and a faint blush.</p>

<p>Pauline's face gleamed with scorn.</p>

<p>"There is no need for any of those pretty airs and graces
with me," she said. "I am going to speak stern truths to you.
You, a young girl, barely twenty, with all your life before you&mdash;surely
you cannot be so shamelessly untrue as even to pretend
that you are marrying an old man like my uncle for love? You
know it is not so&mdash;you dare not even pretend it."</p>

<p>Elinor's face flushed crimson.</p>

<p>"Why do you speak so to me, Miss Darrell?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Because I want to warn you. Are you not ashamed&mdash;yes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
I repeat the word, ashamed&mdash;to sell your youth, your hope of
love, your life itself, for money and title? That is what you are
doing. You do not love Sir Oswald. How should you? He
is more than old enough to be your father. If he were a poor
man, you would laugh his offer to scorn; but he is old and
rich, and you are willing to marry him to become Lady Darrell,
of Darrell Court. Can you, Elinor Rocheford, look me frankly
in the face, and say it is not so?"</p>

<p>No, she could not. Every word fell like a sledge-hammer on
her heart, and she knew it was all true. She bent her crimson
face, and hid it from Pauline's clear gaze.</p>

<p>"Are you not ashamed to sell yourself? If no truth, no
honor, no loyalty impels you to end this barter, let fear step in.
You do not love my uncle. It can give you no pain to give
him up. Pursue your present course, and I warn you. Darrell
Court ought to be mine. I am a Darrell, and when my
uncle took me home it was as his heiress. For a long period I
have learned to consider Darrell Court as mine. It is mine,"
she continued&mdash;"mine by right, for I am a Darrell&mdash;mine by
right of the great love I bear it&mdash;mine by every law that is just
and right! Elinor Rocheford, I warn you, beware how you
step in between me and my birthright&mdash;beware! My uncle is
only marrying you to punish me; he has no other motive.
Beware how you lend yourself to such punishment! I am not
asking you to give up any love. If you loved him, I would not
say one word; but it is not a matter of love&mdash;only of sale and
barter. Give it up!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can you talk so strangely to me, Miss Darrell? I
cannot give it up; everything is arranged."</p>

<p>"You can if you will. Tell my uncle you repent of the unnatural
compact you have made. Be a true woman&mdash;true to
the instinct Heaven has placed in your heart. Marry for love,
nothing else&mdash;pure, honest love&mdash;and then you will live and die
happy. Answer me&mdash;will you give it up?"</p>

<p>"I cannot," murmured the girl.</p>

<p>"You will not, rather. Listen to me. I am a true Darrell,
and a Darrell never breaks a word once pledged. If you marry
my uncle, I pledge my word that I will take a terrible vengeance
on you&mdash;not a commonplace one, but one that shall be
terrible. I will be revenged upon you if you dare to step in between
me and my just inheritance! Do you hear me?"</p>

<p>"I hear. You are very cruel, Miss Darrell. You know that
I cannot help myself. I must fulfill my contract."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Pauline, rising; "then I have no more to
say. But remember, I have given you full, fair, honest warning.
I will be revenged upon you."</p>

<p>And Miss Darrell returned to the house, with haughty head
proudly raised, while Elinor remained in the garden, bewildered
and aghast.</p>

<p>Two things happened. Elinor never revealed a word of what
had transpired, and three weeks from that day Sir Oswald Darrell
married her in the old parish church of Audleigh Royal.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>NO COMPROMISE WITH PAULINE.</div>


<p>It was evident to Miss Hastings that Sir Oswald felt some little
trepidation in bringing his bride home. He had, in spite of
himself, been somewhat impressed by his niece's behavior. She
gave no sign of disappointed greed or ambition, but she bore
herself like one who has been unjustly deprived of her rights.</p>

<p>On the night of the arrival every possible preparation had
been made for receiving the baronet and his wife. The servants,
under the direction of Mr. Frampton, the butler, were
drawn up in stately array. The bells from the old Norman
church of Audleigh Royal pealed out a triumphant welcome;
flags and triumphal arches adorned the roadway. The Court
was looking its brightest and best; the grand old service of
golden plate, from which in olden times, kings and queens had
dined, was displayed. The rooms were made bright with flowers
and warm with fires. It was a proud coming home for Lady
Darrell, who had never known what a home was before. Her
delicate face flushed as her eyes lingered on the splendor around
her. She could not repress the slight feeling of triumph which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
made her heart beat and her pulse thrill as she remembered
that this was all her own.</p>

<p>She bowed right and left, with the calm, suave smile that
never deserted her. As she passed through the long file of servants
she tried her best to be most gracious and winning; but,
despite her delicate, grave, and youthful loveliness, they looked
from her to the tall, queenly girl whose proud head was never
bent, and whose dark eyes had in them no light of welcome.
It might be better to bow to the rising sun, but many of them
preferred the sun that was setting.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald led his young wife proudly through the outer
rooms into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Welcome home, my dear Elinor!" he said. "May every
moment you spend in Darrell Court be full of happiness!"</p>

<p>She thanked him. Pauline stood by, not looking at them.
After the first careless glance at Lady Darrell, which seemed to
take in every detail of her costume, and to read every thought
of her mind, she turned carelessly away.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell sat down near the fire, while Sir Oswald, with
tender solicitude, took off her traveling-cloak, his hands trembling
with eagerness.</p>

<p>"You will like to rest for a few minutes before you go to
your rooms, Elinor," he said.</p>

<p>Then Miss Hastings went up to them, and some general conversation
about traveling ensued. That seemed to break the
ice. Lady Darrell related one or two little incidents of their
journey, and then Sir Oswald suggested that she should go to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
her apartments, as the dinner-bell would ring in half an hour.
Lady Darrell went away, and Sir Oswald soon afterward followed.</p>

<p>Pauline had turned to one of the large stands of flowers, and
was busily engaged in taking the dying leaves from a beautiful
plant bearing gorgeous crimson flowers.</p>

<p>"Pauline," said the governess, "my dear child!"</p>

<p>She was startled. She expected to find the girl looking
sullen, angry, passionate; but the splendid face was only lighted
by a gleam of intense scorn, the dark eyes flashing fire, the ruby
lips curling and quivering with disdain. Pauline threw back
her head with the old significant movement.</p>

<p>"Miss Hastings," she said, "I would not have sold myself
as that girl has done for all the money and the highest rank in
England."</p>

<p>"My dear Pauline, you must not, really, speak in that
fashion. Lady Darrell undoubtedly loves her husband."</p>

<p>The look of scorn deepened.</p>

<p>"You know she does not. She is just twenty, and he is
nearly sixty. What love&mdash;what sympathy can there be between
them?"</p>

<p>"It is not really our business, my dear; we will not discuss
it."</p>

<p>"Certainly not; but as you are always so hard upon what
you call my world&mdash;the Bohemian world, where men and
women speak the truth&mdash;it amuses me to find flaws in yours."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings looked troubled; but she knew it was better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
for the passionate torrent of words to be poured out to her.
Pauline looked at her with that straight, clear, open, honest
look before which all affectation fell.</p>

<p>"You tell me, Miss Hastings, that I am deficient in good-breeding&mdash;that
I cannot take my proper place in your world because
I do not conform to its ways and its maxims. You have
proposed this lady to me as a model, and you would fain see
me regulate all my thoughts and words by her. I would rather
die than be like her! She may be thoroughly lady-like&mdash;I
grant that she is so&mdash;but she has sold her youth, her beauty,
her love, her life, for an old man's money and title. I, with all
my <i>brusquerie</i>, as you call it, would have scorned such sale and
barter."</p>

<p>"But, Pauline&mdash;&mdash;" remonstrated Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>"It is an unpleasant truth," interrupted Pauline, "and you
do not like to hear it. Sir Oswald is Baron of Audleigh Royal
and master of Darrell Court; but if a duke, thirty years older,
had made this girl an offer, she would have accepted him, and
have given up Sir Oswald. What a world, where woman's truth
is so bidden for?"</p>

<p>"My dear Pauline, you must not, indeed, say these things;
they are most unlady-like."</p>

<p>"I begin to think that all truth is unlady-like," returned the
girl, with a laugh. "My favorite virtue does not wear court
dress very becomingly."</p>

<p>"I have never heard that it affects russet gowns either," said
Miss Hastings. "Oh, Pauline, if you would but understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
social politeness, social duties! If you would but keep your
terrible ideas to yourself! If you would but remember that
the outward bearing of life must be as a bright, shining, undisturbed
surface! Do try to be more amiable to Lady Darrell!"</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed the girl, proudly. "I have warned her,
and she has chosen to disregard my warning. I shall never assume
any false appearance of amiability or friendship for her;
it will be war to the knife! I told her so, and she chose to disbelieve
me. I am a Darrell, and the Darrells never break their
word."</p>

<p>Looking at her, the unstudied grace of her attitude, the perfect
pose, the grand face with its royal look of scorn, Miss Hastings
felt that she would rather have the girl for a friend than an
enemy.</p>

<p>"I do hope, for your own sake, Pauline," she said, "that
you will show every respect to Lady Darrell. All your comfort
will depend upon it. You must really compromise matters."</p>

<p>"Compromise matters!" cried Pauline. "You had better
tell the sea to compromise with the winds which have lashed it
into fury. There can be no compromise with me."</p>

<p>The words had scarcely issued from her lips when the dinner-bell
sounded, and Lady Darrell entered in a beautiful evening
dress of white and silver. Certainly Sir Oswald's choice did
him great credit. She was one of the most delicate, the most
graceful of women, fair, caressing, insinuating&mdash;one of those
women who would never dream of uttering barbarous truth
when elegant fiction so much better served their purpose&mdash;who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
loved fine clothes, sweet perfumes, costly jewels&mdash;who preferred
their own comfort in a graceful, languid way to anything else on
earth&mdash;who expected to be waited upon and to receive all
homage&mdash;who deferred to men with a graceful, sweet submission
that made them feel the deference a compliment&mdash;who placed
entire reliance upon others&mdash;whom men felt a secret delight in
ministering to, because they appeared so weak&mdash;one of those
who moved cautiously and graciously with subtle harmonious
action, whose hands were always soft and jeweled, whose touch
was light and gentle&mdash;a woman born to find her place in the lap
of luxury, who shuddered at poverty or care.</p>

<p>Such was Elinor Darrell; and she entered the drawing-room
now with that soft, gliding movement that seemed always to irritate
Pauline. She drew a costly white lace shawl over her fair
shoulders&mdash;the rich dress of silver and white was studded with
pearls. She looked like a fairy vision.</p>

<p>"I think," she said to Miss Hastings, in her quiet, calm way,
"that the evening is cold."</p>

<p>"You have just left a warm country, Lady Darrell," was the
gentle reply. "The South of France is blessed with one of the
most beautiful climates in the world."</p>

<p>"It was very pleasant," said Lady Darrell, with a dreamy little
sigh. "You have been very quiet, I suppose? We must try
to create a little more gayety for you."</p>

<p>She looked anxiously across the room at Pauline; but that
young lady's attention was entirely engrossed by the crimson
flowers of the beautiful plant. Not one line of the superb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
figure, not one expression of the proud face, was lost upon Lady
Darrell.</p>

<p>"I have been saying to Sir Oswald," she continued, looking
intently at the costly rings shining on her fingers, "that youth
likes gayety&mdash;we must have a series of parties and balls."</p>

<p>"Is she beginning to patronize me?" thought Pauline.</p>

<p>She smiled to herself&mdash;a peculiar smile which Lady Darrell
happened to catch, and which made her feel very uncomfortable;
and then an awkward silence fell over them, only broken
by the entrance of Sir Oswald, and the announcement that
dinner was served.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A RICH GIFT DECLINED.</div>


<p>The bride's first dinner at home was over, and had been a
great success. Lady Darrell had not evinced the least emotion;
she had married for her present social position&mdash;for a fine house,
troops of servants, beautiful, warm, fragrant rooms, choice
wines, and luxurious living; it was only part and parcel of what
she expected, and intended to have. She took the chair of state
provided for her, and by the perfect ease and grace of her manner
proved that she was well fitted for it.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald watched her with keen delight, only regretting
that years ago he had not taken unto himself a wife. He was
most courtly, most deferential, most attractive. If Lady Darrell
did occasionally feel weary, and the memory of Aubrey
Langton's face rose between her and her husband, she made no
sign.</p>

<p>When the three ladies withdrew, she made no further efforts
to conciliate Pauline. She looked at her, but seemed almost
afraid to speak. Then she opened a conversation with Miss
Hastings, and the two persevered in their amiable small talk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
until Pauline rose and went to the piano, the scornful glance on
her face deepening.</p>

<p>"This is making one's self amiable!" she thought. "What
a blessing it would be if people would speak only when they had
something sensible to say!"</p>

<p>She sat down before the piano, but suddenly remembered that
she had not been asked to do so, and that she was no longer
mistress of the house&mdash;a reflection sufficiently galling to make
her rise quickly, and go to the other end of the room.</p>

<p>"Pauline," said Lady Darrell, "pray sing for us. Miss
Hastings tells me you have a magnificent voice."</p>

<p>"Have I? Miss Hastings is not so complimentary when she
speaks to me alone."</p>

<p>Then a sudden resolution came to Lady Darrell. She rose
from her seat, and, with the rich robe of silver and white sweeping
around her, she went to the end of the room where Pauline
was standing, tall, stately, and statuesque, turning over the
leaves of a book. The contrast between the two girls&mdash;the
delicate beauty of the one, and the grand loveliness of the
other&mdash;was never more strongly marked.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell laid her white hand, shining with jewels, on
Pauline's arm. She looked up into her proud face.</p>

<p>"Pauline," she said, gently, "will you not be friends? We
have to live together&mdash;will you be friends?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Miss Darrell, in her clear, frank voice. "I
gave you warning. You paid no heed to it. We shall never
be friends."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>A faint smile played round Lady Darrell's lips.</p>

<p>"But, Pauline, do you not see how useless all your resentment
against me is now? My marriage with Sir Oswald has
taken place, and you and I shall have to live together perhaps
for many years&mdash;it would be so much better for us to live in
peace."</p>

<p>The proud face wore its haughtiest look.</p>

<p>"It would be better for you, perhaps, Lady Darrell, but it
can make no difference to me."</p>

<p>"It can, indeed. Now listen to reason&mdash;listen to me!" and
in her eagerness Lady Darrell once more laid her hand on the
girl's arm. Her face flushed as Pauline drew back, with a look
of aversion, letting the jeweled hand fall. "Listen, Pauline!"
persevered Lady Darrell. "You know all this is nonsense&mdash;sheer
nonsense. My position now is established. You can do
nothing to hurt me&mdash;Sir Oswald will take good care of that.
Any attempt that you may make to injure me will fall upon
yourself; besides, you know you can do nothing." In spite of
her words, Lady Darrell looked half-fearfully at the girl's proud,
defiant face. "You may have all kinds of tragic plans for
vengeance in your mind, but there are no secrets in my life that
you can find out to my discredit&mdash;indeed, you cannot injure me
in any possible way." She seemed so sure of it, yet her eyes
sought Pauline's with an anxious, questioning fear. "Now, I,
on the contrary," she went on, "can do much for you&mdash;and I
will. You are young, and naturally wish to enjoy your life.
You shall. You shall have balls and parties, dresses&mdash;everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
that you can wish for, if you will only be friends with
me."</p>

<p>She might as well have thrown drops of oil on an angry ocean
to moderate its wrath.</p>

<p>"Lady Darrell," was the sole reply, "you are only wasting
your time and mine. I warned you. Twenty years may elapse
before my vengeance arrives, but it will come at last."</p>

<p>She walked away, leaving the brilliant figure of the young
bride alone in the bright lamp-light. She did not leave the
room, for Sir Oswald entered at the moment, carrying a small,
square parcel in his hand. He smiled as he came in.</p>

<p>"How pleasant it is to see so many fair faces!" he said.
"Why, my home has indeed been dark until now."</p>

<p>He went up to Lady Darrell, as she stood alone. All the
light in the room seemed to be centered on her golden hair and
shining dress. He said:</p>

<p>"I have brought the little parcel, Elinor, thinking that you
would prefer to give your beautiful present to Pauline herself.
But," he continued, "why are you standing, my love? You
will be tired."</p>

<p>She raised her fair, troubled face to his, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Moreover, it seems to me that you are looking anxious,"
he resumed. "Miss Hastings, will you come here, please? Is
this an anxious look on Lady Darrell's face?"</p>

<p>"I hope not," said the governess, with a gentle smile.</p>

<p>Then Sir Oswald brought a chair, and placed his wife in it;
he next obtained a footstool and a small table. Lady Darrell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
though half-ashamed of the feeling, could not help being thankful
that Pauline did not notice these lover-like attentions.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Hastings," spoke Sir Oswald, "I want you to
admire Lady Darrell's taste."</p>

<p>He opened the parcel. It contained a morocco case, the lid
of which, upon a spring being touched, flew back, exposing a
beautiful suite of rubies set in pale gold.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings uttered a little cry of delight.</p>

<p>"How very beautiful!" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Sir Oswald, holding them up to the light,
"they are, indeed. I am sure we must congratulate Lady Darrell
upon her good taste. I suggested diamonds or pearls, but
she thought rubies so much better suited to Pauline's dark
beauty; and she is quite right."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell held up the shining rubies with her white
fingers, but she did not smile; a look of something like apprehension
came over the fair face.</p>

<p>"I hope Pauline will like them," she said, gently.</p>

<p>"She cannot fail to do so," remarked Sir Oswald, with some
little <i>hauteur</i>. "I will tell her that you want to speak to her."</p>

<p>He went over to the deep recess of the large window, where
Pauline sat reading. He had felt very sure that she would be
flattered by the rich and splendid gift. There had been some
little pride, and some little pomp in his manner as he went in
search of her, but it seemed to die away as he looked at her
face. That was not the face of a girl who could be tempted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
pleased, or coaxed with jewels. Insensibly his manner
changed.</p>

<p>"Pauline," he said, gently, "Lady Darrell wishes to speak
to you."</p>

<p>There was evidently a struggle in her mind as to whether she
should comply or not, and then she rose, and without a word
walked up to the little group.</p>

<p>"What do you require, Lady Darrell?" she asked; and Miss
Hastings looked up at her with quick apprehension.</p>

<p>The fair face of Lady Darrell looked more troubled than
pleased. Sir Oswald stood by, a little more stately and proud
than usual&mdash;proud of his niece, proud of his wife, and pleased
with himself.</p>

<p>"I have brought you a little present, Pauline, from Paris,"
said Lady Darrell. "I hope it will give you pleasure."</p>

<p>"You were kind to remember me," observed Pauline.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald thought the acknowledgment far too cool and
calm.</p>

<p>"They are the finest rubies I have seen, Pauline; they are
superb stones."</p>

<p>He held them so that the light gleamed in them until they
shone like fire. The proud, dark eyes glanced indifferently at
them.</p>

<p>"What have you to say to Lady Darrell, Pauline?" asked Sir
Oswald, growing angry at her silence.</p>

<p>The girl's beautiful lip curled.</p>

<p>"Lady Darrell was good to think of me," she said, coldly;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
"and the jewels are very fine; but they are not suitable for
me."</p>

<p>Her words, simple as they were, fell like a thunder-cloud
upon the little group.</p>

<p>"And pray why not?" asked Sir Oswald, angrily.</p>

<p>"Your knowledge of the world is greater than mine, and will
tell you better than I can," she replied, calmly. "Three
months since they would have been a suitable present to one in
the position I held then; now they are quite out of place, and
I decline them."</p>

<p>"You decline them!" exclaimed Lady Darrell, hardly believing
that it was in human nature to refuse such jewels.</p>

<p>Pauline smiled calmly, repeated the words, and walked
away.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald, with an angry murmur, replaced the jewels in
the case and set it aside.</p>

<p>"She has the Darrell spirit," he said to his wife, with an awkward
smile; and she devoutly hoped that her husband would
not often exhibit the same.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A TRUE DARRELL.</div>


<p>The way in which the girl supported her disappointment was
lofty in the extreme. She bore her defeat as proudly as some
would have borne a victory. No one could have told from her
face or her manner that she had suffered a grievous defeat.
When she alluded to the change in her position, it was with a
certain proud humility that had in it nothing approaching
meanness or envy.</p>

<p>It did not seem that she felt the money-loss; it was not the
disappointment about mere wealth and luxury. It was rather
an unbounded distress that she had been set aside as unworthy
to represent the race of the Darrells&mdash;that she, a "real" Darrell,
had been forced to make way for what, in her own mind,
she called a "baby-faced stranger"&mdash;that her training and education,
on which her dear father had prided himself, should be
cast in her face as unworthy and deserving of reproach. He
and his artist-friends had thought her perfection; that very
"perfection" on which they had prided themselves, and for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
which they had so praised and flattered her, was the barrier that
had stood between her and her inheritance.</p>

<p>It was a painful position, but her manner of bearing it was
exalted. She had not been a favorite&mdash;the pride, the truth, the
independence of her nature had forbidden that. She had not
sought the liking of strangers, nor courted their esteem; she
had not been sweet and womanly, weeping with those who wept,
and rejoicing with those who rejoiced; she had looked around
her with a scorn for conventionalities that had not sat well upon
one so young&mdash;and now she was to pay the penalties for all this.
She knew that people talked about her&mdash;that they said she was
rightly punished, justly treated&mdash;that it was a blessing for the
whole county to have a proper Lady Darrell at Darrell Court
She knew that among all the crowds who came to the Court
there was not one who sympathized with her, or who cared in
the least for her disappointment. No Darrell ever showed
greater bravery than she did in her manner of bearing up under
disappointment. Whatever she felt or thought was most adroitly
concealed. The Spartan boy was not braver; she gave no
sign. No humiliation seemed to touch her, she carried herself
loftily; nor could any one humiliate her when she did not
humiliate herself. Even Sir Oswald admired her.</p>

<p>"She is a true Darrell," he said to Miss Hastings; "what a
grand spirit the girl has, to be sure!"</p>

<p>The Court was soon one scene of gayety. Lady Darrell
seemed determined to enjoy her position. There were garden-parties
at which she appeared radiant in the most charming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
costumes, balls where her elegance and delicate beauty, her
thoroughbred grace, made her the queen; and of all this gayety
she took the lead. Sir Oswald lavished every luxury upon her&mdash;her
wishes were gratified almost before they were expressed.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton, calling rather earlier than usual one day,
found her in her luxurious dressing-room, surrounded by such
treasures of silk, velvet, lace, jewels, ornaments of every description
of the most costly and valuable kind, that her ladyship
looked round in astonishment.</p>

<p>"My dearest Elinor," she said, "what are you doing? What
beautiful confusion!"</p>

<p>Lady Darrell raised her fair face, with a delicate flush and a
half-shy glance.</p>

<p>"Look, aunt," she said, "I am really overwhelmed."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" asked Lady Hampton.</p>

<p>"It means that Sir Oswald is too generous. These large
boxes have just arrived from Paris; he told me they were a surprise
for me&mdash;a present from him. Look at the contents&mdash;dresses
of all kinds, lace, ornaments, fans, slippers, gloves, and
such <i>articles of luxury</i> as can be bought only in Paris. I am
really ashamed."</p>

<p>"Sir Oswald is indeed generous," said Lady Hampton; then
she looked round the room to see if they were quite alone.</p>

<p>The maid had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Ah, Elinor," remarked Lady Hampton, "you are indeed a
fortunate woman; your lines have fallen in pleasant places.
You might have looked all England over and not have found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
such a husband. I am quite sure of one thing&mdash;you have
everything a woman's heart can desire."</p>

<p>"I make no complaint," said Lady Darrell.</p>

<p>"My dear child, I should imagine not; there are few women
in England whose position equals yours."</p>

<p>"I know it," was the calm reply.</p>

<p>"And you may really thank me for it; I certainly worked
hard for you, Elinor. I believe that if I had not interfered you
would have thrown yourself away on that Captain Langton."</p>

<p>"Captain Langton never gave me the chance, aunt; so we
will not discuss the question."</p>

<p>"It was a very good thing for you that he never did," remarked
her ladyship. "Mrs. Bretherton was saying to me the
other day what a very fortunate girl you were&mdash;how few of us
have our heart's desire."</p>

<p>"You forget one thing, aunt. Even if I have everything I
want, still my heart is empty," said the girl, wearily.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton smiled.</p>

<p>"You must have your little bit of sentiment, Elinor, but you
are too sensible to let it interfere with your happiness. How
are you getting on with that terrible Pauline? I do dislike that
girl from the very depths of my heart."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell shrugged her delicate shoulders.</p>

<p>"There is a kind of armed neutrality between us at present,"
she said. "Of course, I have nothing to fear from her, but I
cannot help feeling a little in dread of her, aunt."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Lady Hampton, contemptuously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
"She is a girl I should really delight to thwart and contradict;
but, as for being afraid of her, I consider Frampton, the butler,
a far more formidable person. Why do you say that, Elinor?"</p>

<p>"She has a way with her&mdash;I cannot describe it&mdash;of making
every one else feel small. I cannot tell how she does it, but she
makes me very uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"You have more influence over Sir Oswald than any one else
in the world; if she troubles you, why not persuade him to
send her away?"</p>

<p>"I dare not," said Lady Darrell; "besides, I do not think
he would ever care to do that."</p>

<p>"Then you should be mistress of her, Elinor&mdash;keep her in
her place."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"I do not think even your skill could avail here, aunt. She
is not one of those girls you can extinguish with a frown."</p>

<p>"How does she treat you, Elinor? Tell me honestly," said
Lady Hampton.</p>

<p>"I can hardly describe it. She is never rude or insolent; if
she were, appeal to Sir Oswald would be very easy. She has a
grand, lofty way with her&mdash;an imperious carriage and bearing
that I really think he admires. She ignores me, overlooks me,
and there is a scornful gleam in her eyes at times, when she
does look at me, which says more plainly than words, 'You
married for money.'"</p>

<p>"And you did a very sensible thing, too, my dear. I wish, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
only wish I had the management of Miss Darrell; I would
break her spirit, if it is to be broken."</p>

<p>"I do not think it is," said Lady Darrell, rising as though
she were weary of the discussion. "There is nothing in her
conduct that any one could find fault with, yet I feel she is my
enemy."</p>

<p>"Wait a while," returned Lady Hampton; "her turn will
come."</p>

<p>And from that day the worthy lady tried her best to prejudice
Sir Oswald against his proud, beautiful, wayward niece.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A PUZZLING QUESTION.</div>


<p>"Does Miss Darrell show any signs of disappointment?" inquired
Lady Hampton one day of Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings, although she noticed a hundred faults in the
girl which she would fain have corrected, had nevertheless a true,
strong, and warm affection for her pupil; she was not one therefore
to play into the enemy's hand; and, when Lady Darrell
fixed her eyes upon her, full of eagerness and brightened by
curiosity, Miss Hastings quietly resolved not to gratify her.</p>

<p>"Disappointment about what?" she asked. "I do not understand
you, Lady Hampton."</p>

<p>"About the property," explained Lady Hampton, impatiently.
"She made so very sure of it. I shall never forget her insolent
confidence. Do tell me, is she not greatly annoyed and
disappointed?"</p>

<p>"Not in the way you mean, Lady Hampton. She has never
spoken of such a thing."</p>

<p>Her ladyship felt piqued; she would have preferred to hear
that Pauline did feel her loss, and was grieving over it. In that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
case she would have been kind to her, would have relented;
but the reflection that her pride was still unbending annoyed
her, and she mentally resolved to try if she could not force the
girl into some expression of her feelings. It was not an amiable
resolve, but Lady Hampton was not naturally an amiable
woman.</p>

<p>Fortune favored her. That very day, as she was leaving the
Court, she saw Pauline standing listlessly by the lake side feeding
the graceful white swans. She went up to her with a malicious
smile, only half-vailed by her pretended friendly greeting.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Miss Darrell? You are looking very
melancholy. There is nothing the matter, I hope?"</p>

<p>For any one to attempt to humiliate Pauline was simply a
waste of time; the girl's natural character was so dignified that
all attempts of the kind fell through or told most upon her assailants.
She answered Lady Hampton with quiet politeness,
her dark eyes hardly resting for a moment upon her.</p>

<p>"You do not seem to find much occupation for your leisure
hours," continued Lady Hampton. "You are making the
round of the grounds, I suppose? They are very beautiful. I
am afraid that you must feel keenly how much my niece has deprived
you of."</p>

<p>It was not a lady-like speech; but Lady Hampton felt irresistibly
impelled to make it&mdash;the proud, defiant, beautiful face
provoked her. Pauline merely smiled; she had self-control
that would have done honor to one much older and more experienced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your niece has deprived me of nothing, Lady Hampton,"
she returned, with a curl of the lip, for which the elder lady
could have shaken her. "I possess one great advantage of
which no one living can deprive me&mdash;that is, the Darrell blood
runs in my veins."</p>

<p>And, with a bow, she walked away, leaving her ladyship more
angry than she would have cared to own. So Pauline met all
her enemies. Whatever she might suffer, they should not
triumph over her. Even Sir Oswald felt himself compelled to
yield to her an admiration that he had never given before.</p>

<p>He was walking one evening on the terrace. The western
sunbeams, lingering on the grand old building, brightened it
into beauty. Flowers, trees, and shrubs were all in their fullest
loveliness. Presently Sir Oswald, leaning over the balustrade of
the terrace, saw Pauline sketching in the grounds below. He
went to her, and looked over her shoulder. She was just completing
a sketch of the great western tower of the Court; and
he was struck with the vivid beauty of the drawing.</p>

<p>"You love Darrell Court, Pauline?" he said, gently.</p>

<p>She raised her face to his for a minute; the feud between
them was forgotten. She only remembered that he was a Darrell,
and she his nearest of kin.</p>

<p>"I do love it, uncle," she said, "as pilgrims love their favorite
shrine. It is the home of beauty, of romance, the cradle of
heroes; every stone is consecrated by a legend. Love is a weak
word for what I feel."</p>

<p>He looked at the glowing face, and for a few moments a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
doubt assailed him as to whether he had done right in depriving
this true Darrell of her inheritance.</p>

<p>"But, Pauline," he said, slowly, "you would never have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sprang from her seat with a quickness that almost startled
him. She had forgotten all that had happened; but now it all
returned to her with a bitter pang that could not be controlled.</p>

<p>"Hush, Sir Oswald!" she cried, interrupting him; "it is too
late for us to talk about Darrell Court now. Pray do not misunderstand
me; I was only expressing my belief."</p>

<p>She bent down to take up her drawing materials.</p>

<p>"I do not misunderstand you, child," he said, sadly. "You
love it because it is the home of a race you love, and not for its
mere worth in money."</p>

<p>Her dark eyes seemed to flash with fire; the glorious face
had never softened so before.</p>

<p>"You speak truly," she said; "that is exactly what I mean."</p>

<p>Then she went away, liking Sir Oswald better than she had
ever liked him in her life before. He looked after her half-sadly.</p>

<p>"A glorious girl!" he said to himself; "a true Darrell! I
hope I have not made a mistake."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell made no complaint to her husband of Pauline;
the girl gave her no tangible cause of complaint. She could
not complain to Sir Oswald that Pauline's eyes always rested on
her with a scornful glance, half-humorous, half-mocking. She
could not complain of that strange power Miss Darrell exercised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of making her always "feel so small." She would gladly have
made friends with Miss Darrell; she had no idea of keeping
up any species of warfare; but Pauline resisted all her advances.
Lady Darrell had a strange kind of half-fear, which made her
ever anxious to conciliate.</p>

<p>She remarked to herself how firm and steadfast Pauline was;
there was no weakness, no cowardice in her character; she was
strong, self-reliant; and, discerning that, Lady Darrell asked
herself often, "What will Pauline's vengeance be?"</p>

<p>The question puzzled her far more than she would have cared
to own. What shape would her vengeance assume? What
could she do to avoid it? When would it overtake her?</p>

<p>Then she would laugh at herself. What was there to fear in
the wildly-uttered, dramatic threats of a helpless girl? Could
she take her husband from her? No; it was not in any human
power to do that. Could she take her wealth, title, position,
from her? No; that was impossible. Could she make her unhappy?
No, again; that did not seem to be in her power.
Lady Darrell would try to laugh, but one look at the beautiful,
proud face, with its dark, proud eyes and firm lips, would bring
the coward fear back again.</p>

<p>She tried her best to conciliate her. She was always putting
little pleasures, little amusements, in her way, of which Pauline
never availed herself. She was always urging Sir Oswald to
make her some present or to grant her some indulgence. She
never interfered with her; even when suggestions from her
would have been useful, she never made them. She was mistress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of the house, but she allowed the utmost freedom and
liberty to this girl, who never thanked her, and who never asked
her for a single favor.</p>

<p>Sir Oswald admired this grace and sweetness in his wife more
than he had ever admired anything else. Certainly, contrasted
with Pauline's blunt, abrupt frankness, these pretty, bland,
suave ways shone to advantage. He saw that his wife did her
best to conciliate the girl, that she was always kind and gracious
to her. He saw, also, that Pauline never responded; that
nothing ever moved her from the proud, defiant attitude she
had from the first assumed.</p>

<p>He said to himself that he could only hope; in time things
must alter; his wife's caressing ways must win Pauline over,
and then they would be good friends.</p>

<p>So he comforted himself, and the edge of a dark precipice
was for a time covered with flowers.</p>

<p>The autumn and winter passed away, spring-tide opened fair
and beautiful, and Miss Hastings watched her pupil with daily
increasing anxiety. Pauline never spoke of her disappointment;
she bore herself as though it had never happened, her
pride never once giving way; but, for all that, the governess
saw that her whole character and disposition was becoming
warped. She watched Pauline in fear. If circumstances had
been propitious to her, if Sir Oswald would but have trusted
her, would but have had more patience with her, would but
have awaited the sure result of a little more knowledge and experience,
she would have developed into a noble and magnificent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
woman, she would have been one of the grandest Darrells
that ever reigned at the old Court. But Sir Oswald had not
trusted her; he had not been willing to await the result of
patient training; he had been impetuous and hasty, and,
though Pauline was too proud to own it, the disappointment
preyed upon her until it completely changed her. It was all
the deeper and more concentrated because she made no sign.</p>

<p>This girl, noble of soul, grand of nature, sensitive, proud, and
impulsive, gave her whole life to one idea&mdash;her disappointment
and the vengeance due to it; the very grandeur of her virtues
helped to intensify her faults; the very strength of her character
seemed to deepen and darken the idea over which she brooded
incessantly by night and by day. She was bent on vengeance.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SIR OSWALD'S DOUBTS.</div>


<p>It was the close of a spring day. Lady Hampton had been
spending it at Darrell Court, and General Deering, an old friend
of Sir Oswald's, who was visiting in the neighborhood, had
joined the party at dinner. When dinner was over, and the
golden sunbeams were still brightening the beautiful rooms, he
asked Sir Oswald to show him the picture-gallery.</p>

<p>"You have a fine collection," he said&mdash;"every one tells me
that; but it is not only the pictures I want to see, but the Darrell
faces. I heard the other day that the Darrells were generally
acknowledged to be the handsomest race in England."</p>

<p>The baronet's clear-cut, stately face flushed a little.</p>

<p>"I hope England values us for something more useful than
merely handsome faces," he rejoined, with a touch of <i>hauteur</i>
that made the general smile.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he hastened to say; "but in this age, when personal
beauty is said to be on the decrease, it is something to
own a handsome face."</p>

<p>The picture-gallery was a very extensive one; it was wide and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
well lighted, the floor was covered with rich crimson cloth,
white statues gleamed from amid crimson velvet hangings, the
walls were covered with rare and valuable pictures. But General
Deering saw a picture that day in the gallery which he was
never to forget.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton was not enthusiastic about art unless there
was something to be gained by it. There was nothing to excite
her cupidity now, her last niece being married, so her ladyship
could afford to take matters calmly; she reclined at her ease on
one of the crimson lounges, and enjoyed the luxury of a quiet
nap.</p>

<p>The general paused for a while before some of Horace Vernet's
battle-pieces; they delighted him. Pauline had walked
on to the end of the gallery, and Lady Darrell, always anxious
to conciliate her, had followed. The picture that struck the
general most were the two ladies as they stood side by side&mdash;Lady
Darrell with the sheen of gold in her hair, the soft luster
of gleaming pearls on her white neck, the fairness of her face
heightened by its dainty rose-leaf bloom, her evening dress of
sweeping white silk setting off the graceful, supple lines of her
figure, all thrown into such vivid light by the crimson carpet on
which she stood and the background of crimson velvet; Pauline
like some royal lady in her trailing black robes, with the massive
coils of her dark hair wound round the graceful, haughty head,
and her grand face with its dark, glorious eyes and rich ruby
lips. The one looked fair, radiant, and charming as a Parisian
coquette; the other like a Grecian goddess, superb, magnificent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
queenly, simple in her exquisite beauty&mdash;art or ornaments
could do nothing for her.</p>

<p>"Look," said the general to Sir Oswald, "that picture surpasses
anything you have on your walls."</p>

<p>Sir Oswald bowed.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful girl your niece is!" the old soldier continued.
"See how her face resembles this of Lady Edelgitha
Darrell. Pray do not think me impertinent, but I cannot imagine,
old friend, why you married, so devoted to bachelor life
as you were, when you had a niece so beautiful, so true a Darrell,
for your heiress. I am puzzled now that I see her."</p>

<p>"She lacked training," said Sir Oswald.</p>

<p>"Training?" repeated the general, contemptuously. "What
do you call training? Do you mean that she was not experienced
in all the little trifling details of a dinner-table&mdash;that she
could not smile as she told graceful little untruths? Training!
Why, that girl is a queen among women; a noble soul shines
in her grand face, there is a royal grandeur of nature about her
that training could never give. I have lived long, but I have
never seen such a woman."</p>

<p>"She had such strange, out-of-the-way, unreal notions, I
dared not&mdash;that is the truth&mdash;I dared not leave Darrell Court to
her."</p>

<p>"I hope you have acted wisely," said the general; "but, as
an old friend and a true one, I must say that I doubt it."</p>

<p>"My wife, I am happy to say, has plenty of common sense,"
observed Sir Oswald.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your wife," returned the general, looking at the sheen of
the golden hair and the shining dress, "is pretty, graceful, and
amiable, but that girl has all the soul; there is as much difference
between them as between a golden buttercup and a dark,
stately, queenly rose. The rose should have been ruler at Darrell
Court, old friend."</p>

<p>Then he asked, abruptly:</p>

<p>"What are you going to do for her, Sir Oswald?"</p>

<p>"I have provided for her," he replied.</p>

<p>"Darrell Court, then, and all its rich revenues go to your
wife, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to my wife," said Sir Oswald.</p>

<p>"Unconditionally?" asked the general.</p>

<p>"Most certainly," was the impatient reply.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend," said the general, "in this world every
one does as he or she likes; but to disinherit that girl, with the
face and spirit of a true Darrell, and to put a fair, amiable
blonde stranger in her place, was, to say the least, eccentric&mdash;the
world will deem it so, at any rate. If I were forty years
younger I would win Pauline Darrell, and make her love me.
But we must join the ladies&mdash;they will think us very remiss."</p>

<p>"Sweet smiles, no mind, an amiable manner, no intellect,
prettiness after the fashion of a Parisian doll, to be preferred to
that noble, truthful, queenly girl! Verily tastes differ," thought
the general, as he watched the two, contrasted them, and lost
himself in wonder over his friend's folly.</p>

<p>He took his leave soon afterward, gravely musing on what he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
could not understand&mdash;why his old friend had done what
seemed to him a rash, ill-judged deed.</p>

<p>He left Sir Oswald in a state of great discomfort. Of course
he loved his wife&mdash;loved her with a blind infatuation that did
more honor to his heart than his head&mdash;but he had always relied
so implicitly on the general's judgment. He found himself
half wishing that in this, the crowning action of his life, he had
consulted his old friend.</p>

<p>He never knew how that clever woman of the world, Lady
Hampton, had secretly influenced him. He believed that he
had acted entirely on his own clear judgment; and now, for the
first time, he doubted that.</p>

<p>"You look anxious, Oswald," said Lady Darrell, as she bent
down and with her fresh, sweet young lips touched his brow.
"Has anything troubled you?"</p>

<p>"No, my darling," he replied; "I do not feel quite well,
though. I have had a dull, nervous heaviness about me all
day&mdash;a strange sensation of pain too. I shall be better to-morrow."</p>

<p>"If not," she said, sweetly, "I shall insist on your seeing
Doctor Helmstone. I am quite uneasy about you."</p>

<p>"You are very kind to me," he responded, gratefully.</p>

<p>But all her uneasiness did not prevent her drawing the white
lace round her graceful shoulders and taking up the third volume
of a novel in which she was deeply interested, while Sir
Oswald, looking older and grayer than he had looked before,
went into the garden for a stroll.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The sunbeams were so loth to go; they lingered even now
on the tips of the trees and the flowers; they lingered on the
lake and in the rippling spray of the fountains. Sir Oswald sat
down by the lake-side.</p>

<p>Had he done wrong? Was it a foolish mistake&mdash;one that he
could not undo? Was Pauline indeed the grand, noble,
queenly girl his friend thought her? Would she have made a
mistress suitable for Darrell Court, or had he done right to
bring this fair, blonde stranger into his home&mdash;this dearly-loved
young wife? What would she do with Darrell Court if he left
it to her? The great wish of his heart for a son to succeed him
had not been granted to him; but he had made his will, and in
it he had left Darrell Court to his wife.</p>

<p>He looked at the home he had loved so well. Ah, cruel
death! If he could but have taken it with him, or have
watched over it from another world! But when death came he
must leave it, and a dull, uneasy foreboding came over him as
to what he should do in favor of this idolized home.</p>

<p>As he looked at it, tears rose to his eyes; and then he saw
Pauline standing a little way from him, the proud, beautiful
face softened into tenderness, the dark eyes full of kindness.
She went up to him more affectionately than she had ever done
in her life; she knelt on the grass by his side.</p>

<p>"Uncle," she said, quietly, "you look very ill; are you in
trouble?"</p>

<p>He held out his hands to her; at the sound of her voice all
his heart seemed to go out to this glorious daughter of his race.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pauline," he said, in a low, broken voice, "I am thinking
about you&mdash;I am wondering about you. Have I done&mdash;I wonder,
have I done wrong?"</p>

<p>A clear light flashed into her noble face.</p>

<p>"Do you refer to Darrell Court?" she asked. "If you do,
you have done wrong. I think you might have trusted me. I
have many faults, but I am a true Darrell. I would have done
full justice to the trust."</p>

<p>"I never thought so," he returned, feebly; "and I did it all
for the best, as I imagined, Pauline."</p>

<p>"I know you did&mdash;I am sure you did," she agreed, eagerly;
"I never thought otherwise. It was not you, uncle. I understand
all that was brought to bear upon you. You are a Darrell,
honorable, loyal, true; you do not understand anything
that is not straightforward. I do, because my life has been so
different from yours."</p>

<p>He was looking at her with a strange, wavering expression in
his face; the girl's eyes, full of sympathy, were turned on him.</p>

<p>"Pauline," he said, feebly, "if I have done wrong&mdash;and, oh,
I am so loth to believe it&mdash;you will forgive me, my dear, will
you not?"</p>

<p>For the first time he held out his arms to her; for the first
time she went close to him and kissed his face. It was well
that Lady Hampton was not there to see. Pauline heard him
murmur something about "a true Darrell&mdash;the last of the Darrells,"
and when she raised her head she found that Sir Oswald
had fallen into a deep, deadly swoon.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>READING OF THE WILL.</div>


<p>Assistance was soon procured, and Sir Oswald was carried to
his room; Doctor Helmstone was sent for, and when he arrived
the whole house was in confusion. Lady Darrell wrung her
hands in the most graceful distress.</p>

<p>"Now, Elinor," said Lady Hampton, "pray do not give way
to anything of that kind. It is a fortunate thing for you that I
am here. Let me beg of you to remember that, whatever happens,
you are magnificently provided for, Sir Oswald told me as
much. There is really no need to excite yourself in that
fashion."</p>

<p>While Lady Darrell, with a few graceful exclamations and a
very pretty show of sorrow, managed to attract all possible sympathy,
Pauline moved about with a still, cold face, which those
best understood who knew her nature. It seemed incredible
to the girl that anything unexpected should happen to her
uncle. She had only just begun to love him; that evening
had brought those two proud hearts closer together than they
had ever been; the ice was broken; each had a glimmering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
perception of the real character of the other&mdash;a perception that
in time would have developed into perfect love. It seemed too
hard that after he had just begun to like her&mdash;that as soon as a
fresh and genuine sentiment was springing up between them&mdash;he
must die.</p>

<p>For it had come to that. Care, skill, talent, watching, were
all in vain; he must die. Grave-faced doctors had consulted
about him, and with professional keenness had seen at once
that his case was hopeless. The ailment was a sudden and
dangerous one&mdash;violent inflammation of the lungs. No one
could account for the sudden seizure. Sir Oswald had complained
of pain during the day, but no one thought that it was
anything of a serious nature. His manner, certainly, had been
strange, with a sad pathos quite unlike himself; but no one saw
in that the commencement of a mortal illness.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton frequently observed how fortunate it was that
she was there. To all inquiries as to the health of her niece,
she replied, "Poor, dear Lady Darrell is bearing up wonderfully;"
and with the help of pathetic little speeches, the frequent
use of a vinaigrette, a few tears, and some amiable self-condolence,
that lady did bear up.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the one who felt the keenest sorrow, the deepest
regret, the truest pain, was the niece with whom Sir Oswald
had continually found fault, and whom he had disinherited.
She went about with a sorrow on her face more eloquent than
words. Lady Hampton said it was all assumed; but Lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Darrell said, more gently, that Pauline was not a girl to assume
a grief which she did not feel.</p>

<p>So the baronet died after a week of severe illness, during
which he never regained the power of speech, nor could make
himself intelligible. The most distressing thing was that there
was evidently something which he wished to say&mdash;something
which he desired to make them understand. When Pauline
was in the room his eyes followed her with a wistful glance, pitiful,
sad, distressing; he evidently wished to say something, but
had not the power.</p>

<p>With that wish unexpressed he died, and they never knew
what it was. Only Pauline thought that he meant, even at the
last, to ask her forgiveness and to do her justice.</p>

<p>Darrell Court was thrown into deepest mourning; the servants
went about with hushed footsteps and sorrowful faces.
He had been kind to them, this stately old master; and who
knew what might happen under the new <i>regime?</i> Lady Hampton
was, she assured every one, quite overwhelmed with business.
She had to make all arrangements for the funeral, to
order all the mourning, while Lady Darrell was supposed to be
overwhelmed with sorrow in the retirement of her own room.</p>

<p>One fine spring morning, while the pretty bluebells were
swaying in the wind, and the hawthorn was shining pink and
white on the hedges, while the birds sang and the sun shone,
Sir Oswald Darrell was buried, and the secret of what he had
wished to say or have done was buried with him.</p>

<p>At Lady Darrell's suggestion, Captain Langton was sent for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to attend the funeral. It was a grand and stately procession.
All the <i>elite</i> of the county were there, all the tenantry from Audleigh
Royal, all the friends who had known Sir Oswald and respected
him.</p>

<p>"Was he the last of the Darrells?" one asked of another;
and many looked at the stately, dark-eyed girl who bore the
name, wondering how he had left his property, whether his
niece would succeed him, or his wife take all. They talked of
this in subdued whispers as the funeral <i>cortege</i> wound its way to
the church, they talked of it after the coffin had been lowered
into the vault, and they talked of it as the procession made its
way back to Darrell Court.</p>

<p>As Lady Hampton said, it was a positive relief to open the
windows and let the blessed sunshine in, to draw up the heavy
blinds, to do away with the dark, mourning aspect of the place.</p>

<p>Everything had been done according to rule&mdash;no peer of the
realm could have had a more magnificent funeral. Lady
Hampton felt that in every respect full honor had been done
both to the living and the dead.</p>

<p>"Now," she wisely remarked, "there is nothing to be done,
save to bear up as well as it is possible."</p>

<p>Then, after a solemn and dreary dinner, the friends and invited
guests went away, and the most embarrassing ceremony of
all had to be gone through&mdash;the reading of the will.</p>

<p>Mr. Ramsden, the family solicitor, was in attendance. Captain
Langton, Lady Darrell, Lady Hampton, and Miss Darrell
took their seats. Once or twice Lady Hampton looked with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
smile of malicious satisfaction at the proud, calm face of Pauline.
There was nothing there to gratify her&mdash;no queen could
have assisted at her own dethronement with prouder majesty or
prouder grace. Some of the old retainers, servants who had
been in the family from their earliest youth, said there was not
one who did not wish in his heart that Pauline might have Darrell
Court.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell, clad in deepest mourning, was placed in a large
easy-chair in the center of the group, her aunt by her side.
She looked extremely delicate and lovely in her black sweeping
robes.</p>

<p>Pauline, who evidently thought the ceremony an empty one,
as far as she was concerned, stood near the table. She declined
the chair that Captain Langton placed for her. Her uncle was
dead; she regretted him with true, unfeigned, sincere sorrow;
but the reading of his will had certainly nothing to do with her.
There was not the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'lest'">least</ins> shadow on her face, not the least discomposure
in her manner. To look at her one would never have
thought she was there to hear the sentence of disinheritance.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell did not look quite so tranquil; everything was
at stake for her. She held her dainty handkerchief to her face
lest the trembling of her lips should be seen.</p>

<p>Mr. Ramsden read the will, and its contents did not take any
one much by surprise. The most important item was a legacy
of ten thousand pounds to Captain Aubrey Langton. To Pauline
Darrell was left an annuity of five hundred pounds per
annum, with the strict injunction that she should live at Darrell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Court until her marriage; if she never married, she was to reside
there until her death. To all his faithful servants Sir Oswald
left legacies and annuities. To his well-beloved wife, Elinor,
he bequeathed all else&mdash;Darrell Court, with its rich dependencies
and royal revenues, his estate in Scotland, his house in
town, together with all the valuable furniture, plate, jewelry,
pictures, all the moneys that had accumulated during his life-time&mdash;all
to her, to hold at her will and pleasure; there was no
restriction, no condition to mar the legacy.</p>

<p>To the foregoing Sir Oswald had added a codicil; he left
Miss Hastings one hundred pounds per annum, and begged of
her to remain at Darrell Court as companion to Lady Darrell
and his niece.</p>

<p>Then the lawyer folded up the parchment, and the ceremony
was ended.</p>

<p>"A very proper will," said Lady Hampton; "it really does
poor dear Sir Oswald credit."</p>

<p>They <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hasten'">hastened</ins> to congratulate Lady Darrell; but Captain Langton,
it was noticed, forgot to do so&mdash;he was watching Pauline's
calm, unconcerned departure from the room.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WAITING FOR REVENGE.</div>


<p>There was a slight, only a very slight difference of opinion
between Lady Darrell and her aunt after the reading of the will.
Lady Hampton would fain have given up the Elms, and have
gone to live at Darrell Court.</p>

<p>"Sir Oswald's will is a very just one," she said, "admirable
in every respect; but I should never dream, were I in your
place, Elinor, of keeping that proud girl here. Let her go. I
will come and live with you. I shall make a better chaperon
than that poor, faded Miss Hastings."</p>

<p>But Lady Darrell was eager to taste the sweets of power, and
she knew how completely her aunt would take every vestige of
it from her.</p>

<p>She declared her intention to adhere most strictly to the
terms of the will.</p>

<p>"And, aunt," she continued, with firmness quite new to her,
"it would be so much better, I think, for you to keep at the
Elms. People might make strange remarks if you came here
to live with me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Hampton was shrewd enough to see that she must
abide by her niece's decision.</p>

<p>The captain was to remain only two days at Darrell Court,
and Lady Darrell was anxious to spend some little time with
him.</p>

<p>"I like the captain, aunt," she said; "he amuses me."</p>

<p>Lady Hampton remembered how she had spoken of him before,
and it was not her intention that her beautiful niece should
fling away herself and her magnificent fortune on Aubrey
Langton.</p>

<p>"She is sure to marry again," thought the lady; "and, dowered
as she is, she ought to marry a duke, at least."</p>

<p>She represented to her that it was hardly etiquette for her, a
widow so young, and her loss being so recent, to entertain a
handsome young officer.</p>

<p>"I do not see that the fact of his being handsome makes any
difference, aunt," said Lady Darrell; "still, if you think I must
remain shut up in my room while the captain is here, of course,
I will remain so, though it seems very hard."</p>

<p>"Appearances are everything," observed Lady Hampton,
sagely; "and you cannot be too careful at first."</p>

<p>"Does he seem to pay Pauline any attention?" asked the
young widow, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I have never heard them exchange more than a few words&mdash;indeed
the circumstance has puzzled me, Elinor. I have
seen him look at her as though he worshiped her and as though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
he hated her. As for Miss Darrell, she seems to treat him with
contemptuous indifference."</p>

<p>"I used to think he liked her," said Lady Darrell, musingly.</p>

<p>"He liked the future heiress of Darrell Court," rejoined Lady
Hampton. "All his love has gone with her prospects, you
may rely upon it."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell, brought up in a school that would sacrifice even
life itself for the sake of appearances, knew there was no help
for her enforced retirement. She remained in her rooms until
the young officer had left the Court.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton was not the only one who felt puzzled at Pauline's
behavior to the captain. Miss Hastings, who understood
her pupil perhaps better than any one, was puzzled. There was
somewhat of a calm, unutterable contempt in her manner of
treating him. He could not provoke her; no matter what he
said, she would not be provoked into retort. She never appeared
to remember his existence; no one could have been
more completely ignored; and Captain Langton himself was
but too cognizant of the fact. If he could have but piqued or
aroused her, have stung her into some exhibition of feeling, he
would have been content; but no statue could have been colder,
no queen prouder. If any little attention was required at
her hands she paid it, but there was no denying the fact that it
was rendered in such a manner that the omission would have
been preferable.</p>

<p>On the evening of his departure Lady Hampton went down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to wish him farewell; she conveyed to him Lady Darrell's regret
at not being able to do the same.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," said the captain; "though, of course,
under the circumstances, I could hardly hope for the pleasure
of seeing Lady Darrell. Perhaps you will tell her that in the
autumn, with her permission, I shall hope to revisit the Court."</p>

<p>Lady Hampton said to herself that she should take no such
message. The dearest wish of her heart was that the gallant
captain should never be seen there again. But she made some
gracious reply, and then asked, suddenly:</p>

<p>"Have you seen Miss Darrell? Have you said good-by to
her?"</p>

<p>Aubrey Langton looked slightly confused.</p>

<p>"I have not seen her to-day," he replied.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton smiled very graciously.</p>

<p>"I will send for her," she said; and when, in answer to her
summons, a servant entered, she asked that Miss Darrell might
be requested to favor her with her presence in the library. It
did not escape her keen observation that Captain Langton would
rather have avoided the interview.</p>

<p>Pauline entered with the haughty grace so natural to her;
her proud eyes never once glanced at the captain; he was no
more to her than the very furniture in the room.</p>

<p>"You wished to see me, Lady Hampton," she said, curtly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that is, Captain Langton wishes to say good-by to
you; he is leaving Darrell Court this morning."</p>

<p>There was the least possible curl of the short upper lip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Lady Hampton happened to catch the glance bestowed upon
Pauline by their visitor. For a moment it startled her&mdash;it revealed
at once such hopeless passionate love and such strong
passionate hate. Pauline made no reply; the queenly young
figure was drawn up to its full height, the thoughtful face was
full of scorn. The captain concealed his embarrassment as he
best could, and went up to her with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Miss Darrell," he said; "this has been a very sad
time for you, and I deeply sympathize with you. I hope to see
you again in the autumn, looking better&mdash;more like yourself."</p>

<p>Lady Hampton was wont to declare that the scene was one of
the finest she had ever witnessed. Pauline looked at him with
that straight, clear, calm gaze of hers, so terribly searching and
direct.</p>

<p>"Good-by," she said, gravely, and then, utterly ignoring the
outstretched hands, she swept haughtily from the room.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton did not attempt to conceal her delight at the
captain's discomfiture.</p>

<p>"Miss Darrell is very proud," he said, laughing to hide his
confusion. "I must have been unfortunate enough to displease
her."</p>

<p>But Lady Hampton saw his confusion, and in her own mind
she wondered what there was between these two&mdash;why he should
appear at the same time to love and to hate her&mdash;above all, why
she should treat him with such sovereign indifference and contempt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not natural," she argued to herself; "young girls, as
a rule, admire&mdash;nay, take an uncommon interest in soldiers.
What reason can she have for such contemptuous indifference?"</p>

<p>How little she dreamed of the storm of rage&mdash;of passion&mdash;of
anger&mdash;of love&mdash;of fury, that warred in the captain's soul!</p>

<p>He was ten thousand pounds richer, but it was as a drop in
the ocean to him. If it had been ten thousand per annum he
might have been grateful. Ten thousand pounds would discharge
every debt he had in the world, and set him straight
once more; he might even lead the life he had always meant to
lead for two or three years, but then the money would be gone.
On the other hand, if that girl&mdash;that proud, willful, defiant girl&mdash;would
but have married him, Darrell Court, with all its rich
dependencies, would have been his. The thought almost maddened
him.</p>

<p>How he loathed her as he rode away! But for her, all this
grand inheritance would have been his. Instead of riding
away, he would now be taking possession and be lord and master
of all. These stables with the splendid stud of horses would
be his&mdash;his the magnificent grounds and gardens&mdash;the thousand
luxuries that made Darrell Court an earthly paradise. All these
would have been his but for the obstinacy of one girl. Curses
deep and burning rose to his lips; yet, for his punishment, he
loved her with a love that mastered him in spite of his hate&mdash;that
made him long to throw himself at her feet, while he could
have slain her for the wrong he considered that she had done
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Hampton could not refrain from a few remarks on what
she had witnessed.</p>

<p>"Has Captain Langton been so unfortunate as to offend you,
Miss Darrell?" she asked of Pauline. "I thought your adieus
were of the coldest."</p>

<p>"Did you? I never could see the use of expressing regret
that is not really felt."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but it is strange that you should not feel
some little regret at losing such a visitor."</p>

<p>To this remark Pauline deigned nothing save an extra look
of weariness, which was not lost upon Lady Hampton.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Pauline," said Miss Hastings, one morning, "I do not
think you are compelled by the terms of Sir Oswald's will to
reside at Darrell Court whether you like it or not. There
could be no possible objection to your going away for a
change."</p>

<p>The beautiful, restless face was turned to her.</p>

<p>"I could not leave Darrell Court even if I would," she returned.</p>

<p>"Why not? There is really nothing to detain you here."</p>

<p>"I am waiting," said the girl, her dark eyes lit by a fire that
was not pleasant to see&mdash;"I am waiting here for my revenge."</p>

<p>"Oh, Pauline!" cried Miss Hastings, in real distress. "My
dear child, you must forget such things. I do not like to hear
such a word from your lips."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Pauline smiled as she looked at her governess, but there was
something almost terrible in the calm smile.</p>

<p>"What do you think I am living here for&mdash;waiting here in
patience for? I tell you, nothing but the vengeance I have
promised myself&mdash;and it shall be mine!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WILL FATE AID PAULINE?</div>


<p>Six months had passed since Sir Oswald's death, and his
widow had already put away her cap and heavy weeds. Six
months of retirement, she considered, were a very handsome
acknowledgment of all her husband's love and kindness. She
was in a state of serene and perfect self-content&mdash;everything had
gone well with her. People had expressed their admiration of
her devotion to his memory. She knew that in the eyes of the
world she was esteemed faultless. And now it seemed to Lady
Darrell that the time was come in which she might really enjoy
herself, and reap the reward of her sacrifice.</p>

<p>The "armed neutrality" between Pauline and herself still
continued. Each went her own way&mdash;their interests never
clashed. Lady Darrell rather preferred that Pauline should remain
at the Court. She had a vague kind of fear of her, a
vague dread that made her feel safer where Pauline was, and
where she could know something of her. Whole days would
pass without their meeting; but, now that there was to be a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
more gayety at Darrell Court, the two must expect to be
brought into daily communication.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell was an amiable woman. It was true she had a
small soul, capable of maintaining small ideas only. She
would have liked to be what she called "comfortable" with
Pauline&mdash;to live on sisterly terms with her&mdash;to spend long hours
in discussing dress, ornaments, fashionable gossip&mdash;to feel that
there was always some one at hand to listen to her and to amuse
her. She, in her turn, would have been most generous. She
would have made ample presents of dresses and jewels to such
a friend; she would have studied her comfort and interests.
But to expect or to hope for a companion of that kind in Pauline
was as though some humble little wood-blossom could
hope to train itself round a grand, stately, sad passion-flower.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell's worldly knowledge and tact were almost perfect;
yet they could never reveal to her the depths of a noble
nature like Pauline's. She could sooner have sounded the
depths of the Atlantic than the grand deep of that young girl's
heart and soul; they would always be dead letters to her&mdash;mysteries
she could not solve. One morning the impulse was
strong upon her to seek Pauline, to hold a friendly conversation
with her as to half-mourning; but when she reached the door
of the study her courage gave way, and she turned abruptly,
feeling rather than knowing why the discussion of dress and
mere personal appearance must prove distasteful to Miss
Darrell.</p>

<p>Little by little Lady Darrell began to take her place in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
grand world; she was too wise and wary to do it all at once.
The degrees were almost imperceptible; even Lady Hampton,
one of the most fastidious of critics, was obliged to own to herself
that her niece's conduct was highly creditable. The gradations
in Lady Darrell's spirits were as carefully regulated as the
gradations of color in her dress; with deep lavender and black
ribbons she was mildly sorrowful, the lighter grew the lavender
the lighter grew her heart. On the first day she wore a silver
gray brocade she laughed outright, and the sound of that laugh
was the knell of all mourning.</p>

<p>Visitors began to arrive once more at Darrell Court, but Lady
Darrell still exercised great restraint over herself. Her invitations
were at first confined to matrons of mature age. "She
did not feel equal to the society of gentlemen yet."</p>

<p>There was a grand chorus of admiration for the nice feeling
Lady Darrell displayed. Then elderly gentlemen&mdash;husbands
of the matrons&mdash;were admitted; and, after a time, "braw wooers
began to appear at the hall," and then Lady Darrell's reign
began in real earnest.</p>

<p>From these admiring matrons, enthusiastic gentlemen, ardent
lovers, and flattering friends Pauline stood aloof. How she despised
the whole of them was to be gathered only from her face;
she never expressed it in words. She did not associate with
them, and they repaid her behavior by the most hearty dislike.</p>

<p>It was another proof of "dear Lady Darrell's sweet temper"
that she could live in peace with this haughty, abrupt, willful
girl. No one guessed that the bland, amiable, suave, graceful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
mistress of Darrell Court stood in awe of the girl who had been
disinherited to make way for her.</p>

<p>"Pauline," said Miss Hastings, one day, "I want you to accustom
yourself to the idea of leaving Darrell Court; for I do
not think there is any doubt but that sooner or later Lady Darrell
will marry again."</p>

<p>"I expect it," she returned. "Poor Sir Oswald! His home
will go to strangers, his name be extinct. How little he foresaw
this when he married!"</p>

<p>"Let it take place when it may, the Court can be no home
for you then," continued Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>Pauline raised her hand with a warning gesture.</p>

<p>"Do not say another word, Miss Hastings; I cannot listen.
Just as criminals were fastened to the rack, bound to the wheel,
tied to the stake, I am bound here&mdash;awaiting my revenge!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Pauline, if you would but forego such strange speech!
This longing for vengeance is in your heart like a deadly canker
in a fair flower. It will end badly."</p>

<p>The beautiful face with its defiant light was turned toward
her.</p>

<p>"Do not attempt to dissuade me," she said. "Your warning
is useless, and I do not like to grieve you. I acquainted
Lady Darrell with my determination before she married my
uncle for his money. She persisted in doing it. Let her take
the consequences&mdash;bear the penalty. If she had acted a true
womanly part&mdash;if she had refused him, as she ought to have
done&mdash;he would have had time for reflection, he would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
have disinherited me in his anger, and Darrell Court would
have descended to a Darrell, as it ought to have done."</p>

<p>"If you could but forget the past, Pauline!"</p>

<p>"I cannot&mdash;it is part of my life now. I saw two lives before
me once&mdash;the one made noble, grand, and gracious by this inheritance,
which I should have known so well how to hold; the
other darkened by disappointment and shadowed by revenge.
You know how some men wait for the fair fruition of a fair
hope&mdash;for the dawn of success&mdash;for the sunshine of perfect
prosperity; so do I wait for my revenge. We Darrells never do
things by halves; we are not even moderate. My heart, my
soul, my life&mdash;which might have been, I grant, filled with high
impulses&mdash;are concentrated on revenge."</p>

<p>Though the words she spoke were so terrible, so bitter, there
was no mean, vindictive, or malign expression on that beautiful
face; rather was it bright with a strange light. Mistaken
though the idea might be, Pauline evidently deemed herself one
chosen to administer justice.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings looked at her.</p>

<p>"But, Pauline," she said, gravely, "who made you Lady
Darrell's judge?"</p>

<p>"Myself," she replied. "Miss Hastings, you often speak of
justice; let me ask, was this matter fair? My uncle was irritated
against me because I would not marry a man I detested and
loathed; in his anger he formed the project of marriage to punish
me. He proposed to Elinor Rocheford, and, without any
love for him, she agreed to marry him. I went to her, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
warned her not to come between me and my rightful inheritance.
I told her that if she did I would be revenged. She
laughed at my threat, married my uncle, and so disinherited
me. Now, was it fair that I should have nothing, she all&mdash;that
I, a Darrell, should see the home of my race go to strangers?
It is not just, and I mean to take justice into my hands."</p>

<p>"But, Pauline," opposed Miss Hastings, "if Lady Darrell
had not accepted Sir Oswald, some one else would."</p>

<p>"Are such women common, then?" she demanded, passionately.
"I knew evil enough of your world, but I did not know
this. This woman is sweet-voiced, her face is fair, her hair is
golden, her hands are white and soft, her manners caressing
and gentle; but you see her soul is sordid&mdash;it was not large
enough to prevent her marrying an old man for his money.
Something tells me that the vengeance I have promised myself
is not far off."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings wrung her hands in silent dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh, for something to redeem you, Pauline&mdash;something to
soften your heart, which is hardening into sin!"</p>

<p>"I do not know of any earthly influence that could, as you
say, redeem me. I know that I am doing wrong. Do not
think that I have transformed vice into virtue and have blinded
myself. I know that some people can rise to a far grander
height; they would, instead of seeking vengeance, pardon injuries.
I cannot&mdash;I never will. There is no earthly influence
that can redeem me, because there is none stronger than my
own will."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The elder lady looked almost hopelessly at the younger one.
How was she to cope with this strong nature&mdash;a nature that
could own a fault, yet by strength of will persevere in it? She
felt that she might as well try to check the angry waves of the
rising tide as try to control this willful, undisciplined disposition.</p>

<p>How often in after years these words returned to her mind:
"I know of no earthly influence stronger than my own will."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings sat in silence for some minutes, and then she
looked at the young girl.</p>

<p>"What shape will your vengeance take, Pauline?" she asked,
calmly.</p>

<p>"I do not know. Fate will shape it for me; my opportunity
will come in time."</p>

<p>"Vengeance is a very high-sounding word," observed Miss
Hastings, "but the thing itself generally assumes very prosaic
forms. You would not descend to such a vulgar deed as murder,
for instance; nor would you avail yourself of anything so
commonplace as poison."</p>

<p>"No," replied Pauline, with contempt; "those are mean revenges.
I will hurt her where she has hurt me&mdash;where all the
love of her heart is garnered; there will I wound her as she has
wounded me. Where she can feel most there I mean to strike,
and strike home."</p>

<p>"Then you have no definite plan arranged?" questioned Miss
Hastings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fate will play into my hands when the time comes," replied
Pauline. Nor could the governess extract aught further from
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FATE FAVORS PAULINE.</div>


<p>Autumn, with its golden grain, its rich fruits, and its luxuriant
foliage, had come and gone; then Christmas snow lay soft
and white on the ground; and still Captain Langton had not
paid his promised visit to Darrell Court. He sent numerous
cards, letters, books, and music, but he did not appear himself.
Once more the spring flowers bloomed; Sir Oswald had been
lying for twelve months in the cold, silent family vault. With
the year of mourning the last of Lady Darrell's gracefully expressed
sorrow vanished&mdash;the last vestige of gray and lavender,
of jet beads and black trimmings, disappeared from her dresses;
and then she shone forth upon the world in all the grace and
delicate loveliness of her fair young beauty.</p>

<p>Who could number her lovers or count her admirers? Old
and young, peer and commoner, there was not one who would
not have given anything he had on earth to win the hand of the
beautiful and wealthy young widow.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton favored the suit of Lord Aynsley, one of the
wealthiest peers in England. He had met Lady Darrell while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
on a visit at the Elms, and was charmed with her. So young,
fair, gifted, accomplished, so perfect a mistress of every art and
grace, yet so good and amiable&mdash;Lord Aynsley thought that he
had never met with so perfect a woman before.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton was delighted.</p>

<p>"I think, Elinor," she said, "that you are one of the most
fortunate of women. You have a chance now of making a second
and most brilliant marriage. I think you must have been
born under a lucky star."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell laughed her soft, graceful little laugh.</p>

<p>"I think, auntie," she returned, "that, as I married the first
time to please you, I may marry now to please myself and my
own heart."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said her ladyship, dubiously; "but remember
what I have always told you&mdash;sentiment is the ruin of everything."</p>

<p>And, as Lady Hampton spoke, there came before her the
handsome face of Aubrey Langton. She prayed mentally that
he might not appear again at Darrell Court until Lord Aynsley
had proposed and had been accepted.</p>

<p>But Fate was not kind to her.</p>

<p>The next morning Lady Darrell received a letter from the
captain, saying that, as the summer was drawing near, he should
be very glad to pay his long-promised visit to Darrell Court.
He hoped to be with them on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell's fair face flushed as she read. He was coming,
then, this man who above all others had taken her fancy captive&mdash;this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
man whom, with all her worldly scheming, she would
have married without money if he had but asked her. He was
coming, and he would see her in all the glory of her prosperity.
He would be almost sure to fall in love with her; and she&mdash;well,
it was not the first time that she whispered to her own
heart how gladly she would love him. She was too excited by
her pleasant news to be quite prudent. She must have a confidante&mdash;she
must tell some one that he was coming.</p>

<p>She went to the study, where Miss Hastings and Pauline were
busily engaged with some water-colors. She held the open letter
in her hand.</p>

<p>"Miss Hastings, I have news for you," she said. "I know
that all that interested Sir Oswald is full of interest for you.
Pauline, you too will be pleased to hear that Captain Langton
is coming. Sir Oswald loved him very much."</p>

<p>Pauline knew that, and had cause to regret it.</p>

<p>"I should be much pleased," continued Lady Darrell, "if,
without interfering with your arrangements, you could help me
to entertain him."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings looked up with a smile of assent.</p>

<p>"Anything that lies in my power," she said, "I shall be only
too happy to do; but I fear I shall be rather at a loss how to
amuse a handsome young officer like Captain Langton."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell laughed, but looked much pleased.</p>

<p>"You are right," she said&mdash;"he is handsome. I do not
know that I have ever seen one more handsome."</p>

<p>Then she stopped abruptly, for she caught the gleam of Pauline's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
scornful smile&mdash;the dark eyes were looking straight at her.
Lady Darrell blushed crimson, and the smile on Pauline's lips
deepened.</p>

<p>"I see my way now," she said to herself. "Time, fate, and
opportunity will combine at last."</p>

<p>"And you, Pauline," inquired Lady Darrell, in her most
caressing manner&mdash;"you will help me with my visitor&mdash;will you
not?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, I must <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'deline'">decline</ins>," answered Miss Darrell.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought Captain Langton and yourself were great
friends!" cried Lady Darrell.</p>

<p>"I am not answerable for your thoughts, Lady Darrell," said
Pauline.</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;you sing so beautifully! Oh, Pauline, you must
help me!" persisted Lady Darrell.</p>

<p>She drew nearer to the girl, and was about to lay one white
jeweled hand on her arm, but Pauline drew back with a haughty
gesture there was no mistaking.</p>

<p>"Pray understand me, Lady Darrell," she said&mdash;"all arts
and persuasions are, as you know, lost on me. I decline to do
anything toward entertaining your visitor, and shall avoid him
as much as possible."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell looked up, her face pale, and with a frightened
look upon it.</p>

<p>"Why do you speak so, Pauline? You must have some
reason for it. Tell me what it is."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>No one had ever heard Lady Darrell speak so earnestly
before.</p>

<p>"Tell me!" she repeated, and her very heart was in the
words.</p>

<p>"Pardon me if I keep my counsel," said Pauline. "There
is wisdom in few words."</p>

<p>Then Miss Hastings, always anxious to make peace, said:</p>

<p>"Do not be anxious, Lady Darrell; Pauline knows that
some of the unpleasantness she had with Sir Oswald was owing
to Captain Langton. Perhaps that fact may affect her view of
his character."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell discreetly retired from the contest.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will both do all you can," she said, in her
most lively manner. "We must have some charades, and a
ball; we shall have plenty of time to talk this over when our
guests arrive." And, anxious to go before Pauline said anything
more, Lady Darrell quitted the room.</p>

<p>"My dear Pauline," said Miss Hastings, "if you would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she paused suddenly, for Pauline was sitting with a rapt
expression on her face, deaf to every word.</p>

<p>Such a light was in those dark eyes, proud, triumphant, and
clear&mdash;such a smile on those curved lips; Pauline looked as
though she could see into futurity, and as though, while the
view half frightened, it pleased her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose from her seat, with her hands clasped, evidently
forgetting that she was not alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing could be better," she said. "I could not have
asked of fate or fortune anything better than this."</p>

<p>When Miss Hastings, wondering at her strange, excited manner,
asked her a question, she looked up with the vague manner
of one just aroused from deep sleep.</p>

<p>"What are you thing of, Pauline?" asked Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>"I am thinking," she replied, with a dreamy smile, "what
good fortune always attends those who know how to wait. I
have waited, and what I desired is come."</p>

<p>Thursday came at last. Certainly Lady Darrell had spared
neither time nor expense in preparing for her visitor; it was
something like a warrior's home-coming&mdash;the rarest of wines,
the fairest of flowers, the sweetest of smiles awaiting him.
Lady Darrell's dress was the perfection of good taste&mdash;plain
white silk trimmed with black lace, with a few flowers in her
golden hair. She knew that she was looking her best; it was
the first time that the captain had seen her in her present
position, so she was anxious to make the most favorable impression
on him.</p>

<p>"Welcome once more to Darrell Court!" she said, holding
out one white hand in greeting.</p>

<p>"It seems like a welcome to Paradise," said the captain, profanely;
and then he bowed with the grace of a Chesterfield over
the little hand that he still held clasped in his own.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CAPTAIN LANGTON ACCEPTED.</div>


<p>Lady Darrell was obliged to own herself completely puzzled.
All the girls she had ever known had not only liked admiration,
but had even sought it; she could not understand why Pauline
showed such decided aversion to Captain Langton. He was
undeniably handsome, graceful, and polished in manner; Lady
Darrell could imagine no one more pleasant or entertaining.
Why should Pauline show such great distaste for his society,
and such avoidance of him?</p>

<p>There were times, too, when she could not quite understand
Aubrey Langton. She had seen him look at Pauline with an
expression not merely of love, but with something of adoration
in his eyes; and then again she would be startled by a look of
something more fierce and more violent even than hate. She
herself was in love with him; nor was she ashamed to own the
fact even to herself. She could let her heart speak now&mdash;its
voice had been stifled long enough; still she would have liked
to know the cause of Pauline's avoidance of him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>On the second day of his visit Lady Darrell gave a grand
dinner-party. Lady Hampton, who viewed the captain's arrival
with great disfavor, was, as a matter of course, to be present.
All the neighbors near were invited, and Pauline, despite her
dislike, saw that she must be present.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell took this opportunity of appearing, for the first
time since Sir Oswald's death, <i>en grande toilette</i>. She wore a
dress of blue brocade, a marvel of color and weaving, embroidered
with flowers, the very delicacy of which seemed to attract
notice. She wore the Darrell diamonds, her golden head being
wreathed with a tiara of precious stones. She looked marvelously
bright and radiant; her face was flushed with the most
delicate bloom, her eyes were bright with happiness. The
guests remarked to each other how lovely their young hostess
was.</p>

<p>But when Pauline entered the room, Lady Darrell was
eclipsed, even as the light of the stars is eclipsed by that of the
sun. Pauline wore no jewels; the grand beauty of her face
and figure required none. The exquisite head and graceful,
arched neck rose from the clouds of gray tulle like some superb
flower from the shade of its leaves; her dress was low, showing
the white neck and statuesque shoulders; the dark, clustering
hair was drawn back from the noble brow, a pomegranate blossom
glowing in the thick coils. Graceful and dignified she
looked, without glitter of jewels or dress&mdash;simple, perfect in
the grandeur of her own loveliness.</p>

<p>She was greatly admired; young men gazed at her from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
distance with an expression almost of infatuation, while the
ladies whispered about her; yet no one had the courage to pay
her any great attention, from the simple fact that Lady Hampton
had insinuated that the young widow did not care much
about Miss Darrell. Some felt ill at ease in her presence; her
proud, dark eyes seemed to detect every little false grace and
affectation, all paltry little insincerities seemed to be revealed to
her.</p>

<p>Yet Pauline on this occasion did her best. Despite Sir Oswald's
false judgment of her, there was an innate refinement
about her, and it showed itself to-night. She talked principally
to old Lady Percival, who had known her mother, and who
professed and really felt the most profound liking and affection
for Pauline; they talked during dinner and after dinner, and
then, seeing that every one was engaged, and that no one was
likely to miss her, Pauline slipped from the room and went
out.</p>

<p>She gave a long sigh of relief as she stood under the broad,
free sky; flowers and birds, sunshine and shade, the cool,
fragrant gloaming, were all so much more beautiful, so much
more to her taste, than the warm, glittering rooms. In the
woods a nightingale was singing. What music could be compared
to this? The white almond blossoms were falling as she
went down to the lakeside, where her dreams were always
fairest.</p>

<p>"I wonder," mused the girl, "why the world of nature is so
fair, and the world of men and women so stupid and so inane."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pauline," said a voice near her, "I have followed you; I
could not help doing so."</p>

<p>She turned hastily, and saw Captain Langton, his face
flushed, his eyes flaming with a light that was not pleasant to
see.</p>

<p>"How have you dared to do so?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I dare do anything," he replied, "for you madden me.
Do you hear? You madden me!"</p>

<p>She paid no more heed to his words than she did to the humming
of the insects in the grass.</p>

<p>"You shall hear me!" he cried. "You shall not turn away
your haughty head! Look at me&mdash;listen to me, or I will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or you will murder me," she interrupted. "It will not be
the first time you have used that threat. I shall neither look at
you nor listen to you."</p>

<p>"Pauline, I swear that you are driving me mad. I love you
so dearly that my life is a torment, a torture to me; yet I hate
you so that I could almost trample your life out under my feet.
Be merciful to me. I know that I may woo and win this glittering
widow. I know that I may be master of Darrell Court&mdash;she
has let me guess that much&mdash;but, Pauline, I would rather
marry you and starve than have all the world for my own."</p>

<p>She turned to him, erect and haughty, her proud face flushing,
her eyes so full of scorn that their light seemed to blind
him.</p>

<p>"I did not think," she said, "that you would dare to address
such words to me. If I had to choose this instant between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
death and marrying you, I would choose death. I know no
words in which I can express my scorn, my contempt, my loathing
for you. If you repeat this insult, it will be at your peril.
Be warned."</p>

<p>"You are a beautiful fiend!" he hissed. "You shall suffer
for your pride!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, calmly; "go and marry Lady Darrell. I
have vowed to be revenged upon her; sweeter vengeance I
could not have than to stand by quietly while she marries you."</p>

<p>"You are a beautiful fiend!" he hissed again, his face white
with rage, his lips dry and hot.</p>

<p>Pauline turned away, and he stood with deeply muttered imprecations
on his lips.</p>

<p>"I love her and I hate her," he said; "I would take her in
my arms and carry her away where no one in the world could
see her beautiful face but myself. I could spend my whole life
in worshiping her&mdash;yet I hate her. She has ruined me&mdash;I could
trample her life out. 'Go and marry Lady Darrell,' she said;
I will obey her."</p>

<p>He returned to the house. No one noticed that his face was
paler than usual, that his eyes were shadowed and strange; no
one knew that his breath came in hot gasps, and that his heart
beat with great irregular throbs.</p>

<p>"I will woo Lady Darrell and win her," he said, "and then
Pauline shall suffer."</p>

<p>What a contrast that graceful woman, with her fair face and
caressing manner, presented to the girl he had just left, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
her passionate beauty and passionate scorn! Lady Darrell
looked up at him with eyes of sweetest welcome.</p>

<p>"You have been out in the grounds," she said, gently; "the
evening is very pleasant."</p>

<p>"Did you miss me, Lady Darrell&mdash;Elinor?" he asked, bending
over her chair.</p>

<p>He saw a warm blush rising in her cheeks, and in his heart
he felt some little contempt for the conquest so easily made.</p>

<p>"Did you miss me, Elinor?" he repeated. "You must let
me call you Elinor&mdash;I think it is the sweetest name in all the
world."</p>

<p>It was almost cruel to trifle with her, for, although she was
conventional to the last degree, and had but little heart, still
what heart she had was all his. It was so easy to deceive her,
too; she was so ready to believe in him and love him that her
misplaced affection was almost pitiable. She raised her blue
eyes to his; there was no secret in them for him.</p>

<p>"I am very glad my name pleases you," she said; "I never
cared much for it before."</p>

<p>"But you will like it now?" he asked; and then bending
over her chair, he whispered something that sent a warm, rosy
flush over her face and neck.</p>

<p>Every one noticed the attention he paid her; Lady Hampton
saw it, and disliked him more than ever. Lord Aynsley saw it,
and knew that all hope of winning the beautiful widow was over
for him. People made their comments upon it, some saying it
would be an excellent match, for Sir Oswald had been much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
attached to Captain Langton, others thinking that Lady Darrell,
with her fair face and her large fortune, might have done better.
There was something, too, in the captain's manner which puzzled
simple-hearted people&mdash;something of fierce energy, which
all the softness of word and look could not hide.</p>

<p>"There is not much doubt of what will be the next news
from Darrell Court," said one to another.</p>

<p>No one blamed the young widow for marrying again, but
there was a general expression of disappointment that she had
not done better.</p>

<p>Those dwelling in the house foresaw what was about to take
place. Aubrey Langton became the widow's shadow. Wherever
she went he followed her; he made love to her with the
most persevering assiduity, and it seemed to be with the energy
of a man who had set himself a task and meant to go through
with it.</p>

<p>He also assumed certain airs of mastership. He knew that
he had but to speak one word, and Darrell Court would be his.
He spoke in a tone of authority, and the servants had already
begun to look upon him as their master.</p>

<p>Silent, haughty, and reserved, Pauline Darrell stood aside
and watched&mdash;watched with a kind of silent triumph which
filled Miss Hastings with wonder&mdash;watched and spoke no word&mdash;allowed
her contempt and dislike to be seen in every action,
yet never uttered one word&mdash;watched like a beautiful, relentless
spirit of fate.</p>

<p>Throughout the bright, long summer months Aubrey Langton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
staid on at Darrell Court, and at last did what he intended
to do&mdash;proposed to Lady Darrell. He was accepted. It was
the end of July then, but, yielding to her regard for appearances,
it was agreed that no further word should be said of marriage
until the spring of the following year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"I HAVE HAD MY REVENGE!"</div>


<p>It was a warm, beautiful morning, with a dull haze lying over
the fair summer earth; and Pauline Darrell, finding even the
large, airy rooms too warm, went out to seek her favorite shade&mdash;the
shelter of the great cedar tree. As she sat with her book
in her hand&mdash;of which she never turned a page&mdash;Miss Hastings
watched her, wondering at the dark shadow that had fallen over
her beauty, wondering at the concentration of thought in her
face, wondering whether this shadow of disappointment would
darken all her life or if it would pass away, wondering if the
vengeance to which she had vowed herself was planned yet;
and to them, so silent and absorbed, came the pretty, bright
vision of Lady Darrell, wearing a white morning dress with blue
ribbons in her golden hair. The brightness and freshness of
the morning seemed to linger on her fair face, as she drew near
them with a smile on her lips, and a look of half-proud shyness
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are both here," she said; "I have something
to tell you." The blush and the smile deepened. "Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
you can guess what it is. Miss Hastings, you are smiling&mdash;Pauline,
you do not look at me. Captain Langton has asked
me to be his wife, and I have consented."</p>

<p>Then she paused. Miss Hastings congratulated her, and
wished her much happiness. Pauline started at first, clasping
her hands while her face grew white, and then she recovered
herself and kept perfect silence.</p>

<p>"Pauline," said Lady Darrell, "I am very happy; do not
shadow my happiness. Will you not wish me joy?"</p>

<p>"I cannot," replied the girl, in a trembling voice; "you will
have no joy."</p>

<p>Then, seeing Lady Darrell's wondering face, she seemed to
recover herself more completely.</p>

<p>"I will wish you," she said, bitterly, "as much happiness as
you deserve."</p>

<p>"That would be but little," returned Lady Darrell, with a
faint laugh; "I do not hold myself a particularly deserving
person."</p>

<p>Then Miss Hastings, thinking they might come to a better
understanding alone, went away, leaving them together.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell went up to the girl. She laid her hands on her
arm appealingly, and raised her face with a pleading expression.</p>

<p>"Pauline," she said, her lips trembling with emotion, "after
all, I was your uncle's wife; for his sake you might show me a
little kindness. Marriage is a tie for life, not a bond for one
day. Oh, Pauline, Pauline, if there is any reason why I should
not marry Aubrey Langton, tell it&mdash;for Heaven's sake, tell it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Your manner is always so strange to him; if you know anything
against him, tell me now before it is too late&mdash;tell me!"</p>

<p>There fell over them a profound silence, broken only by the
sweet, cheery music of a bird singing in the cedar tree, and the
faint sighing of the wind among the leaves.</p>

<p>"Tell me, for Heaven's sake!" repeated Lady Darrell, her
grasp tightening on Pauline's arm.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to tell," was the curt reply. "Pray do not
hold my arm so tightly, Lady Darrell; I have nothing to tell."</p>

<p>"Do not deceive me&mdash;there must be some reason for your
strange manner. Tell it to me now, before it is too late."</p>

<p>There was almost an agony of pleading in her face and voice,
but Pauline turned resolutely away, leaving her beneath the
cedar alone.</p>

<p>"I must be mistaken," Lady Darrell thought. "What can
she know of him? I must be wrong to doubt him; surely if I
doubt him I shall doubt Heaven itself. It is her manner&mdash;her
awkward manner&mdash;nothing more."</p>

<p>And she tried her best to dismiss all thoughts of Pauline from
her mind, and give herself to her newly-found happiness.</p>

<p>"Pauline," said Miss Hastings, sorrowfully, when she rejoined
the girl, "I cannot understand you."</p>

<p>"I do not quite understand myself," returned Miss Darrell.
"I did not think I had any weakness or pity in my heart, but I
find it is there."</p>

<p>"You frighten me," said Miss Hastings. "What makes you
so strange? O, Pauline, throw it off, this black shadow that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
envelopes you, and forget this idea of vengeance which has so
completely changed you!"</p>

<p>She looked up with a smile&mdash;a hard, bitter smile.</p>

<p>"I shall have had my revenge," she said, gloomily, "when
she has married him."</p>

<p>Nor could any entreaties, any prayers of the kind-hearted
woman move her to say more.</p>

<p>Whether the mysterious and uncertain aspect of things preyed
upon Miss Hastings' mind, whether she grieved over her pupil
and allowed that grief to disturb her, was never revealed, but in
the month of August she became seriously ill&mdash;not ill enough
to be obliged to keep her room, but her health and her strength
failed her, and day by day she became weaker and less able to
make any exertion.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell sent for Doctor Helmstone, and he advised Miss
Hastings to go to the sea-side at once, and to remain there during
the autumn. At her earnest request Pauline consented to
accompany her.</p>

<p>"The change will do you good as well as myself," said the
anxious lady; and Miss Darrell saw that she was thinking how
much better it would be that she should leave Darrell Court.</p>

<p>"I will go," she said. "I know what you are thinking of.
My vengeance is nearly accomplished. There is no reason now
why I should remain here."</p>

<p>After many consultations it was agreed that they should go to
the pretty little watering-place called Omberleigh. Many things
recommended it; the coast was sheltered, the scenery beautiful,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the little town itself very quiet, the visitors were few and of the
higher class. It was not possible to find a prettier spot than
Omberleigh.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell was generosity itself! In her quiet, amiable
way she liked Miss Hastings as well as she was capable of liking
any one. She insisted upon making all kinds of arrangements
for the governess&mdash;she was to have every comfort, every luxury.</p>

<p>"And you must do nothing," she said, in her most caressing
manner, "but try to get well. I shall expect to see you looking
quite young and blooming when you return."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell had already written to Omberleigh, and, through
an agent there, had secured beautiful apartments. When Miss
Hastings half remonstrated with her, she laughed.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do," she said, "but make every one
happy; and it is my duty to find you always a comfortable
home."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell looked, as she was in those days, a most happy
woman. She seemed to have grown younger and fairer. The
height of her ambition, the height of her happiness, was reached
at last. She was rich in the world's goods, and it was in her
power to make the man she loved rich and powerful too. She
was, for the first time in her life, pleasing her own heart; and
happiness made her more tender, more amiable, more considerate
and thoughtful for others.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton mourned over the great mistake her niece
was making. She had whispered in confidence to all her dear
friends that Elinor was really going to throw herself away on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
captain after all. It was such a pity, she said, when Lord
Aynsley was so deeply in love with her.</p>

<p>"But then," she concluded, with a sigh, "it is a matter in
which I cannot interfere."</p>

<p>Yet, looking at Lady Darrell's bright, happy face, she could
not quite regret the captain's existence.</p>

<p>"You will not be lonely, Lady Darrell," said Miss Hastings,
the evening before her journey.</p>

<p>She never forgot the light that spread over the fair young face&mdash;the
intense happiness that shone in the blue eyes.</p>

<p>"No," she returned, with a sigh of unutterable content, "I
shall never be lonely again. I have thoughts and memories
that keep my heart warm&mdash;all loneliness or sorrow is over for
me."</p>

<p>On the morrow Miss Darrell and the governess were to go to
Omberleigh, but the same night Lady Darrell went to Pauline's
room.</p>

<p>"I hope you will excuse me," she said, when the girl looked
up in haughty surprise. "I want to say a few words to you before
you go."</p>

<p>The cool, formal terms on which they lived were set aside,
and for the first time Lady Darrell visited Pauline in her room.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you one great favor," continued Lady Darrell.
"Will you promise me that Miss Hastings shall not want for
anything? She is far from strong."</p>

<p>"I shall consider Miss Hastings my own especial charge,"
said Pauline.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you must allow me to help you. I have a very great
affection for her, and desire nothing better than to prove it by
kind actions."</p>

<p>"Miss Hastings would be very grateful to you if she knew
it," said Pauline.</p>

<p>"But I do not want her to be grateful. I do not want her
to know anything about it. With all her gentleness, Miss Hastings
has an independence quite her own&mdash;an independence that
I respect greatly; but it is quite possible, you know, Pauline,
to manage an invalid&mdash;to provide good wine and little delicacies."</p>

<p>"I will do all that myself," observed the young girl.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell went nearer to her.</p>

<p>"Pauline," she said, gently, "you have always repelled every
effort of mine; you would not be friends with me. But now,
dear&mdash;now that I am so much happier, that I have no cloud in
my sky save the shadow of your averted face&mdash;be a little kinder
to me. Say that you forgive me, if I have wronged you."</p>

<p>"You have wronged me, Lady Darrell, and you know it.
For me to talk of forgiveness is only a farce; it is too late for
that. I have had my revenge!"</p>

<p>Lady Darrell looked up at her with a startled face.</p>

<p>"What is that you say, Pauline?"</p>

<p>"I repeat it," said the girl, huskily&mdash;"I have had my revenge!"</p>

<p>"What can you mean? Nothing of moment has happened
to me. You are jesting, Pauline."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be well for you if I were," said the girl; "but I
tell you in all truth I have had my revenge!"</p>

<p>And those words sounded in Lady Darrell's ears long after
Pauline had left Darrell Court.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE STRANGER ON THE SANDS.</div>


<p>The tide was coming in, the sun setting over the sea; the
crimson and golden light seemed to be reflected in each drop of
water until the waves were one mass of heaving roseate gold; a
sweet western wind laden with rich, aromatic odors from the
pine woods seemed to kiss the waves as they touched the shore
and broke into sheets of beautiful white foam. It was such a
sunset and such a sea&mdash;such a calm and holy stillness. The
golden waters stretched out as far and wide as the eye could
reach. The yellow sands were clear and smooth; the cliffs that
bounded the coast were steep and covered with luxuriant green
foliage. Pauline Darrell had gone to the beach, leaving Miss
Hastings, who already felt much better, to the enjoyment of an
hour's solitude.</p>

<p>There was a small niche in one of the rocks, and the young
girl sat down in it, with the broad, beautiful expanse of water
spread out before her, and the shining waves breaking at her
feet. She had brought a book with her, but she read little;
the story did not please her. The hero of it was too perfect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
With her eyes fixed on the golden, heaving expanse of water,
she was thinking of the difference between men in books and
men in real life. In books they were all either brave or vicious&mdash;either
very noble or very base.</p>

<p>She passed in review all the men she had ever known, beginning
with her kind-hearted, genial father, the clever humorist
artist, who could define a man's character in an epigram so
skillfully. He was no hero of romance; he liked his cigar, his
"glass," and his jest. She thought of all his rugged, picturesque
artist-comrades, blunt of speech, honest of heart, open-handed,
generous, self-sacrificing men, who never envied a comrade's
prosperity, nor did even their greatest enemy an evil
turn; yet they were not heroes of romance. She thought of
Sir Oswald&mdash;the stately gentleman of the old school, who had
held his name and race so dear, yet had made so fatal an error
in his marriage and will. She thought of the captain, handsome
and polished in manner, and her face grew pale as she remembered
him. She thought of Lord Aynsley, for whom she
had a friendly liking, not unmixed with wonder that he could
so deeply love the fair, soft-voiced, inane Lady Darrell.</p>

<p>Then she began to reflect how strange it was that she had
lived until now, yet had never seen a man whom she could
love. Her beautiful lips curled in scorn as she thought of it.</p>

<p>"If ever I love any one at all," she said to herself, "it must
be some one whom I feel to be my master. I could not love a
man who was weak in body, soul, heart, or mind. I must feel
that he is my master; that my soul yields to his; that I can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
look up to him as the real guiding star of my life, as the guide
of my actions. If ever I meet such a man, and vow to love
him, what will my love do for me? I do not think I could fall
in love with a book-hero either; they are too coldly perfect. I
should like a hero with some human faults, with a touch of
pride capable of being roused into passion."</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the thought shaped itself in her mind, she saw
a tall figure crossing the sands&mdash;the figure of a man, walking
quickly.</p>

<p>He stopped at some little distance from the cliff, and then
threw himself on the sand. His eyes were fixed on the restless,
beautiful sea; and she, attracted by his striking masculine beauty,
the statuesque attitude, the grand, free grace of the strong
limbs, the royal carriage of the kingly head, watched him. In
the Louvre she had seen some marvelous statues, and he reminded
her of them. There was one of Antinous, with a
grand, noble face, a royal head covered with clusters of hair,
and the stranger reminded her of it.</p>

<p>She looked at him in wonder. She had seen picturesque-looking
men&mdash;dandies, fops&mdash;but this was the first time she had
ever seen a noble and magnificent-looking man.</p>

<p>"If his soul is like his face," she thought to herself, "he is a
hero."</p>

<p>She watched him quite unconsciously, admiration gradually
entering her heart.</p>

<p>"I should like to hear him speak," she thought. "I know
just what kind of voice ought to go with that face."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a dreamy spot, a dreamy hour, and he was all unconscious
of her presence. The face she was watching was like
some grand, harmonious poem to her; and as she so watched
there came to her the memory of the story of Lancelot and
Elaine. The restless golden waters, the yellow sands, the cliffs,
all faded from her view, and she, with her vivid imagination,
saw before her the castle court where Elaine first saw him, lifted
her eyes and read his lineaments, and then loved him with a
love that was her doom. The face on which she gazed was
marked by no great and guilty love&mdash;it was the face of Lancelot
before his fall, when he shone noblest, purest, and grandest of
all King Arthur's knights.</p>

<p>"It was for his face Elaine loved him," thought the girl&mdash;"grand
and noble as is the face on which the sun shines now."</p>

<p>Then she went through the whole of that marvelous story;
she thought of the purity, the delicate grace, the fair loveliness
of Elaine, as contrasted with the passionate love which, flung
back upon itself, led her to prefer death to life&mdash;of that strange,
keen, passionate love that so suddenly changed the whole world
for the maid of Astolat.</p>

<p>"And I would rather be like her," said the girl to herself;
"I would rather die loving the highest and the best than live
loving one less worthy."</p>

<p>It had seized her imagination, this beautiful story of a deathless
love.</p>

<p>"I too could have done as Elaine did," she thought; "for
love cannot come to me wearing the guise it wears to others. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
could read the true nobility of a man's soul in his face; I could
love him, asking no love in return. I could die so loving him,
and believing him greatest and best."</p>

<p>Then, as she mused, the sunlight deepened on the sea, the
rose became purple, the waters one beaming mass of bright
color, and he who had so unconsciously aroused her sleeping
soul to life rose and walked away over the sands. She watched
him as he passed out of sight.</p>

<p>"I may never see him again," she thought; "but I shall remember
his face until I die."</p>

<p>A great calm seemed to fall over her; the very depths of her
heart had been stirred. She had been wondering so short a
time before if she should ever meet any one at all approaching
the ideal standard of excellence she had set up in her mind. It
seemed like an answer to her thoughts when he crossed the
sands.</p>

<p>"I may never see him again," she said; "but I shall always
remember that I have met one whom I could have loved."</p>

<p>She sat there until the sun had set over the waters and the
moon had risen; and all the time she saw before her but one
image&mdash;the face that had charmed her as nothing in life had
ever done before. Then, startled to find that it had grown so
late, she rose and crossed the sands. Once she turned to look
at the sea, and a curious thought came to her that there, by the
side of the restless, shining waters, she had met her fate. Then
she tried to laugh at the notion.</p>

<p>"To waste one's whole heart in loving a face," she thought,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
"would be absurd. Yet the sweetest of all heroines&mdash;Elaine&mdash;did
so."</p>

<p>A great calm, one that lulled her brooding discontent, that
stilled her angry despair, that seemed to raise her above the
earth, that refined and beautified every thought, was upon her.
She reached home, and Miss Hastings, looking at the beautiful
face on which she had never seen so sweet an expression, so
tender a light before, wondered what had come over her. So,
too, like Elaine&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
All night his face before her lived,<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and the face was</div>

<div class='poem'>
Dark, splendid, sparkling in the silence, full<br />
Of noble things.<br />
</div>

<p>All unconsciously, all unknowingly, the love had come to
her that was to work wonders&mdash;the love that was to be her redemption.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE STORY OF ELAINE.</div>


<p>Miss Hastings laid down the newspaper, with a quick glance
of pleased surprise.</p>

<p>"I am glad that I came to Omberleigh," she said. "Imagine,
Pauline, who is here. You have heard me speak of the
St. Lawrences. I educated Laura St. Lawrence, and she married
well and went to India. Her husband holds a very high
appointment there. Lady St. Lawrence is here with her son,
Sir Vane. I am so pleased."</p>

<p>"And I am pleased for you," responded Pauline, with the
new gentleness that sat so well upon her.</p>

<p>"I must go and see them," continued Miss Hastings.
"They are staying at Sea View. We can soon find out where
Sea View is."</p>

<p>"St. Lawrence!" said Pauline, musingly; "I like the name;
it has a pleasant sound."</p>

<p>"They are noble people who bear it," observed Miss Hastings.
"Lady St. Lawrence was always my ideal of a thoroughbred
English gentlewoman. I never heard how it was, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
greater part of their fortune was lost when Sir Arthur died. He
left but this one son, Vane; and, although he has the title, he
has but little to support it with. I know their family estates
were all sold. Lady St. Lawrence has a small fortune of her
own; but it is not much."</p>

<p>Again Pauline repeated the name to herself&mdash;"Vane St. Lawrence!"&mdash;thinking
there was a sound as of half-forgotten music
in it. That was a name that would have suited the face she
had watched on the sands.</p>

<p>"Vane St. Lawrence!"</p>

<p>Unconsciously to herself she had said the words aloud. Miss
Hastings looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"Did you speak, my dear?" she asked; and Pauline wondered
to find her face suddenly grow warm with a burning
blush.</p>

<p>"I think," said Miss Hastings, presently, "that I should like
to visit them at once. Lady St. Lawrence may not be staying
long, and I should never forgive myself if I were to miss her.
Will you come with me, Pauline?"</p>

<p>"Yes, willingly."</p>

<p>She was ready to go anywhere, to do anything, with that
great, wonderful love, that great, grand calm, filling her heart
and soul.</p>

<p>For the first time the sight of her own magnificent loveliness
pleased her.</p>

<p>"I may see him again," she thought to herself with almost
child-like simplicity, "and I should like him to think of me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>She took more pains than she had ever taken before; and the
picturesque taste that was part of her character greatly assisted
her. Her dress was of purple silk, plain, rich, and graceful;
her hat, with its drooping purple plume, looked like a crown
on the beautiful head. She could no more help looking royal
and queenly than she could help the color of her eyes and hair.
Miss Hastings looked up with a smile of surprise, the proud
face was so wonderfully beautiful&mdash;the light that never yet shone
on land or sea was shining on it.</p>

<p>"Why, Pauline," she said, laughing, "Lady St. Lawrence
will think I am taking the Queen of Sheba in disguise! What
strange change is coming over you, child?"</p>

<p>What indeed? Was it the shadow of the love that was to redeem
her&mdash;to work wonders in her character? Was it the light
that came from the half-awakening soul? Wiser women than
good, kindly, simple-hearted Miss Hastings might have been
puzzled.</p>

<p>They were not long in finding Sea View&mdash;a pretty villa a little
way out of the town, standing at the foot of a cliff, surrounded
by trees and flowers&mdash;one of the prettiest spots in Omberleigh.
They were shown into the drawing-room, the windows of which
commanded a magnificent view of the sea.</p>

<p>Before they had been there many minutes there entered a
fair, gentle, gracious lady, whose eyes filled with tears as she
greeted Miss Hastings warmly.</p>

<p>"You are like a spirit from the past," she said. "I can see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Laura a little child again as I look at you. Nothing could
have pleased me so much as seeing you."</p>

<p>Then she looked admiringly at the beautiful girl by her side.
Miss Hastings introduced her.</p>

<p>"Miss Darrell," she said, "it seems strange that I should
meet you. My husband in his youth knew Sir Oswald well."</p>

<p>Lady St. Lawrence was just what Miss Hastings had described
her&mdash;a thoroughly high-bred English lady. In figure she was
tall and upright; her face had been beautiful in its youth, and
was even now comely and fair; the luxuriant brown hair was
streaked here and there with silver. She wore a dress of rich
brocade, with some becoming arrangement of flowers and lace
on her head; she was charming in her lady-like simplicity and
gentleness.</p>

<p>Pauline, knowing that the two ladies would have much to
talk about, asked permission to amuse herself with some books
she saw upon the table.</p>

<p>"They belong to my son," said Lady St. Lawrence, with a
smile.</p>

<p>There were Tennyson, Keats, and Byron, and written inside
of each, in a bold, clear hand, was the name "Vane St. Lawrence."
Pauline lost herself again in the sweet story of Elaine,
from which she was aroused at intervals by the repetition of the
words&mdash;"My son Vane."</p>

<p>She could not help hearing some part of Lady St. Lawrence's
confidential communication, and it was to the effect how deeply
she deplored the blindness of her son, who might marry his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
cousin Lillith Davenant, one of the wealthiest heiresses in England.
Miss Hastings was all kindly sympathy.</p>

<p>"It would be such an excellent thing for him," continued
Lady St. Lawrence; "and Lillith is a very nice girl. But it is
useless counseling him; Vane is like his father. Sir Arthur,
you know, always would have his own way."</p>

<p>Pauline began to feel interested in this Vane St. Lawrence,
who refused to marry the wealthy heiress because he did not
love her.</p>

<p>"He must be somewhat like me," she said to herself with a
smile.</p>

<p>Then the conversation changed, and Lady St. Lawrence began
to speak of her daughter Laura and her children. Pauline
returned to Elaine, and soon forgot everything else.</p>

<p>She was aroused by a slight stir. She heard Lady St. Lawrence
say:</p>

<p>"My dear Vane, how you startled me!"</p>

<p>Looking up, she saw before her the same face that had engrossed
her thoughts and fancy!</p>

<p>She was nearer to it now, and could see more plainly the exquisite
refinement of the beautiful mouth, the clear, ardent expression
of the bold, frank eyes, the gracious lines of the clustering
hair. Her heart seemed almost to stand still&mdash;it was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits this word">as</ins>
though she had suddenly been brought face to face with a
phantom.</p>

<p>He was bending over Lady St. Lawrence, talking eagerly to
her&mdash;he was greeting Miss Hastings with much warmth and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
cordiality. Pauline had time to recover herself before Lady St.
Lawrence remembered her. She had time to still the wild
beating of her heart&mdash;to steady her trembling lips&mdash;but the flush
was still on her beautiful face and the light in her eyes when he
came up to her.</p>

<p>Lady St. Lawrence spoke, but the words sounded to Pauline
as though they came from afar off; yet they were very simple.</p>

<p>"Miss Darrell," she said, "let me introduce my son to you."</p>

<p>Then she went back to Miss Hastings, eager to renew the
conversation interrupted by the entrance of her son.</p>

<p>What did Sir Vane see in those dark eyes that held him captive?
What was looking at him through that most beautiful
face? What was it that seemed to draw his heart and soul from
him, never to become his own again? To any other stranger
he would have spoken indifferent words of greeting and welcome;
to this dark-eyed girl he could say nothing. When
souls have spoken, lips have not much to say.</p>

<p>They were both silent for some minutes; and then Sir Vane
tried to recover himself. What had happened to him? What
strange, magic influence was upon him? Ten minutes since
he had entered that room heart-whole, fancy-free, with laughter
on his lips, and no thought of coming fate. Ten minutes had
worked wonders of change; he was standing now in a kind of
trance, looking into the grand depths of those dark eyes wherein
he had lost himself.</p>

<p>They said but few words; the calm and silence that fell over
them during that first interval was not to be broken; it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
more eloquent than words. He sat down by her side; she still
held the book open in her hands. He glanced at it.</p>

<p>"Elaine," he said, "do you like that story?"</p>

<p>She told him "Yes," and, taking the book from her hands,
he read the noble words wherein Sir Lancelot tells the Lily
Maid how he will dower her when she weds some worthy
knight, but that he can do no more for her.</p>

<p>Was it a dream that she should sit there listening to those
words from his lips&mdash;she had fancied him Sir Lancelot without
stain, and herself Elaine? There was a sense of unreality
about it; she would not have been surprised at any moment to
awake and find herself in the pretty drawing-room at Marine
Terrace&mdash;all this beautiful fairy tale a dream&mdash;only a dream.
The musical voice ceased at last; and it was to her as though
some charm had been broken.</p>

<p>"Do you like poetry, Miss Darrell?" inquired Sir Vane.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied; "it seems to me part of myself. I cannot
explain clearly what I mean, but when I hear such grand
thoughts read, or when I read them for myself, it is to me as
though they were my own."</p>

<p>"I understand," he responded&mdash;"indeed I believe that I
should understand anything you said. I could almost fancy
that I had lived before, and had known you in another life."</p>

<p>Then Lady St. Lawrence said something about Sea View,
and they left fairy-land for a more commonplace sphere of existence.</p>

<p>"If anything can redeem her, it will be love." So Miss
Hastings had said of Pauline long months ago, when she had
first seen her grand nature warped and soured by disappointment,
shadowed by the fierce desire of revenge. Now she was
to see the fulfillment of her words.</p>

<p>With a nature like Pauline's, love was no ordinary passion;
all the romance, the fervor, the poetry of her heart and soul
were aroused. Her love took her out of herself, transformed
and transfigured her, softened and beautified her. She was not
of those who could love moderately, and, if one attachment
was not satisfactory, take refuge in another. For such as her
there was but one love, and it would make or mar her life.</p>

<p>Had Sir Vane St. Lawrence been merely a handsome man
she would never have cared for him; but his soul and mind had
mastered her. He was a noble gentleman, princely in his
tastes and culture, generous, pure, gifted with an intellect magnificent
in itself, and cultivated to the highest degree of perfection.
The innate nobility of his character at once influenced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
her. She acknowledged its superiority; she bowed her heart
and soul before it, proud of the very chains that bound her.</p>

<p>How small and insignificant everything else now appeared!
Even the loss of Darrell Court seemed trifling to her. Life had
suddenly assumed another aspect. She was in an unknown
land; she was happy beyond everything that she had ever conceived
or imagined it possible to be. It was a quiet, subdued
happiness, one that was dissolving her pride rapidly as the sunshine
dissolves snow&mdash;happiness that was rounding off the
angles of her character, that was taking away scorn and defiance,
and bringing sweet and gracious humility, womanly
grace and tenderness in their stead.</p>

<p>While Sir Vane was studying her as the most difficult problem
he had ever met with, he heard from Miss Hastings the story of
her life. He could understand how the innate strength and
truth of the girl's character had rebelled against polite insincerities
and conventional untruths; he could understand that a soul
so gifted, pure, and eager could find no resting-place and no
delight; he could understand, too, how the stately old baronet,
the gentleman of the old school, had been frightened at his
niece's originality, and scared by her uncompromising love of
truth.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings, whose favorite theme in Pauline's absence was
praise of her, had told both mother and son the story of Sir
Oswald's project and its failure&mdash;how Pauline would have been
mistress of Darrell Court and all her uncle's immense wealth if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
she would but have compromised matters and have married
Aubrey Langton.</p>

<p>"Langton?" questioned Sir Vane. "I know him&mdash;that is, I
have heard of him; but I cannot remember anything more than
that he is a great <i>roue</i>, and a man whose word is never to be believed."</p>

<p>"Then my pupil was right in her estimate of his character,"
said Miss Hastings. "She seemed to guess it by instinct. She
always treated him with the utmost contempt and scorn. I
have often spoken to her about it."</p>

<p>"You may rely upon it, Miss Hastings, that the instinct of a
good woman, in the opinion she forms of men, is never
wrong," observed Sir Vane, gravely; and then he turned to
Lady St. Lawrence with the sweet smile his face always wore for
her.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, gently, "after hearing of such heroism
as that, you must not be angry about Lillith Davenant again."</p>

<p>"That is a very different matter," opposed Lady St. Lawrence;
but it seemed to her son very much the same kind of
thing.</p>

<p>Before he had known Pauline long he was not ashamed to
own to himself that he loved her far better than all the world
beside&mdash;that life for him, unless she would share it, was all
blank and hopeless. She was to him as part of his own soul,
the center of his existence; he knew she was beautiful beyond
most women, he believed her nobler and truer than most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
women had ever been. His faith in her was implicit; he loved
her as only noble men are capable of loving.</p>

<p>As time passed on his influence over her became unbounded.
Quite unconsciously to herself she worshiped him; unconsciously
to herself her thoughts, her ideas, all took their coloring
from his. She who had delighted in cynicism, whose beautiful
lips had uttered such hard and cruel words, now took from
him a broader, clearer, kinder view of mankind and human
nature. If at times the old habit was too strong for her, and
some biting sarcasm would fall from her, some cold cynical
sneer, he would reprove her quite fearlessly.</p>

<p>"You are wrong, Miss Darrell&mdash;quite wrong," he would say.
"The noblest men have not been those who sneered at their
fellow-men, but those who have done their best to aid them.
There is little nobility in a deriding spirit."</p>

<p>And then her face would flush, her lips quiver, her eyes take
the grieved expression of a child who has been hurt.</p>

<p>"Can I help it," she would say, "when I hear what is false?"</p>

<p>"Your ridicule will not remedy it," he would reply. "You
must take a broader, more kindly view of matters. You think
Mrs. Leigh deceitful, Mrs. Vernon worldly; but, my dear Miss
Darrell, do you remember this, that in every woman and man
there is something good, something to be admired, some grand
or noble quality? It may be half-hidden by faults, but it is
there, and for the sake of the good we must tolerate the bad.
No one is all bad. Men and women are, after all, created by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
God; and there is some trace of the Divine image left in every
one."</p>

<p>This was a new and startling theory to the girl who had
looked down with contempt not unmixed with scorn on her fellow-creatures&mdash;judging
them by a standard to which few ever
attain.</p>

<p>"And you really believe there is something good in every
one?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Something not merely good, but noble. My secret conviction
is that in every soul there is the germ of something noble,
even though circumstances may never call it forth. As you
grow older and see more of the world, you will know that I am
right."</p>

<p>"I believe you!" she cried, eagerly. "I always believe every
word you say!"</p>

<p>Her face flushed at the warmth of her words.</p>

<p>"You do me justice," he said. "I have faults by the million,
but want of sincerity is not among them."</p>

<p>So, little by little, love redeemed Pauline, took away her
faults, and placed virtues in their stead. It was almost marvelous
to note how all sweet, womanly graces came to her, how
the proud face cleared and grew tender, how pride died from
the dark eyes, and a glorious love-light came in its stead, how
she became patient and gentle, considerate and thoughtful, always
anxious to avoid giving pain to others. It would have
been difficult for any one to recognize the brilliant, willful Pauline<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Darrell in the loving, quiet, thoughtful girl whom love had
transformed into something unlike herself.</p>

<p>There came a new world to her, a new life. Instead of problems
difficult to solve, life became full of sweet and gracious
harmonies, full of the very warmth and light of Heaven, full of
unutterable beauty and happiness; her soul reveled in it, her
heart was filled with it.</p>

<p>All the poetry, the romance, had come true&mdash;nay, more than
true. Her girlish dreams had not shown her such happiness as
that which dawned upon her now. She had done what she had
always said she should do&mdash;recognized her superior, and yielded
full reverence to him. If anything had happened to disenchant
her, if it had been possible for her to find herself mistaken in
him, the sun of the girl's life would have set forever, would have
gone down in utter darkness, leaving her without hope.</p>

<p>This beautiful love-idyl did not remain a secret long; perhaps
those most interested were the last to see it. Miss Hastings,
however, had watched its progress, thankful that her
prophecy about her favorite was to come true. Later on Lady
St. Lawrence saw it, and, though she could not help mourning
over Lillith Davenant's fortune, she owned that Pauline Darrell
was the most beautiful, the most noble, the most accomplished
girl she had ever met. She had a moderate fortune, too; not
much, it was true; yet it was better than nothing.</p>

<p>"And, if dear Vane has made up his mind," said the lady,
meekly, "it will, of course, be quite useless for me to interfere."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Vane and Pauline were always together; but hitherto no
word of love had been spoken between them. Sir Vane always
went to Marine Terrace the first thing in the morning; he liked
to see the beautiful face that had all the bloom and freshness of
a flower. He always contrived to make such arrangements as
would insure that Pauline and he spent the morning together.
The afternoon was a privileged time; it was devoted by the
elder ladies, who were both invalids, to rest. During that interval
Sir Vane read to Pauline, or they sat under the shadow of
the great cliffs, talking until the two souls were so firmly knit
that they could never be severed again. In the evening they
walked on the sands, and the waves sang to them of love that
was immortal, of hope that would never die&mdash;sang of the sweet
story that would never grow old.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PRIDE BROUGHT LOW.</div>


<p>Pauline could have passed her life in the happy dream that
had come to her; she did not go beyond it&mdash;the golden present
was enough for her. The full, happy, glorious life that beat in
her heart and thrilled in her veins could surely never be more
gladsome. She loved and was beloved, and her lover was a
king among men&mdash;a noble, true-hearted gentleman, the very
ideal of that of which she had always dreamed; she did not
wish for any change. The sunrise was blessed because it
brought him to her; the sunset was as dear, for it gave her time
to dream of him. She had a secret longing that this might go
on forever; she had a shy fear and almost child-like dread of
words that must be spoken, seeing that, let them be said when
they would, they must bring a great change into her life.</p>

<p>In this she was unlike Sir Vane; the prize he hoped to win
seemed to him so beautiful, so valuable, that he was in hourly
dread lest others should step in and try to take it from him&mdash;lest
by some mischance he should lose that which his whole
soul was bent upon winning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>He understood the girlish shyness and sweet fear that had
changed the queenly woman into a timid girl; he loved her all
the more for it, and he was determined to win her if she was to
be won. Perhaps she read that determination in his manner,
for of late she had avoided him. She remained with Miss
Hastings, and, when that refuge was denied her, she sought
Lady St. Lawrence; but nothing could shield her long.</p>

<p>"Miss Darrell," said Sir Vane, one afternoon, "I have a
poem that I want to read to you."</p>

<p>She was seated on a low stool at Lady St. Lawrence's feet,
her beautiful face flushing at his words, her eyes drooping with
shy, sweet pleasure that was almost fear.</p>

<p>"Will you not read it to me now, and here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No; it must be read by the sea. It is like a song, and the
rush of the waves is the accompaniment. Miss Hastings, if
you have brought up your pupil with any notion of obedience,
enforce it now, please. Tell Miss Darrell to put on her hat and
come down to the shore."</p>

<p>Miss Hastings smiled.</p>

<p>"You are too old now, Pauline, to be dictated to in such
matters," said Miss Hastings; "but if Sir Vane wishes you to
go out, there is no reason why you should not oblige him."</p>

<p>Lady St. Lawrence laid her hand on the beautiful head.</p>

<p>"My son has few pleasures," she said; "give him this one."</p>

<p>Pauline complied. Time had been when anything like a
command had instantly raised a spirit of rebellion within her;
but in this clearer light that had fallen upon her she saw things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
so differently; it was as though her soul had eyes and they were
just opened.</p>

<p>She rose and put on the pretty, plumed hat which Miss Hastings
brought for her; she drew an Indian shawl over her shoulders.
She never once looked at Sir Vane.</p>

<p>"Your goodness is not only an act of charity," he said, "but
it is also a case in which virtue will be its own reward. You
have no notion how beautifully the sun is shining on the sea."</p>

<p>So they went out together, and Lady St. Lawrence looked
after them with a sigh.</p>

<p>"She is a most beautiful girl, certainly, and I admire her. If
she only had Lillith Davenant's money!"</p>

<p>Sir Vane and Pauline walked in silence down to the shore,
and then the former turned to his companion.</p>

<p>"Miss Darrell," he said, "will you tell me why you were not
willing to come out with me&mdash;why you have avoided me and
turned the light of your beautiful face from me?"</p>

<p>Her face flushed, and her heart beat, but she made no
answer.</p>

<p>"I have borne my impatience well for the last three days,"
he said; "now I must speak to you, for I can bear it no longer,
Pauline. Oh, do not turn away from me! I love you, and I
want you to be my wife&mdash;my wife, darling; and I will love you&mdash;I
will cherish you&mdash;I will spend my whole life in working for
you. I have no hope so great, so sweet, so dear, as the hope
of winning you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>She made him no answer. Yet her silence was more eloquent
than words.</p>

<p>"It seems a strange thing to say, but, Pauline, I loved you
the first moment I saw you. Do you remember, love? You
were sitting with one of my books in your hand, and the instant
my eyes fell upon your beautiful face a great calm came
over me. I could not describe it; I felt that in that minute
my life was completed. My whole heart went out to you, and
I knew, whether you ever learned to care for me or not, that
you were the only woman in all the world for me."</p>

<p>She listened with a happy smile playing round her beautiful
lips, her dark eyes drooping, her flower-like face flushed and
turned from his.</p>

<p>"You are my fate&mdash;my destiny! Ah! if you love me, Pauline&mdash;if
you will only love me, I shall not have lived in vain!
Your love would incite me to win name and fame&mdash;not for myself,
but for you. Your love would crown a king&mdash;what would
it not do for me? Turn your face to me, Pauline? You are
not angry? Surely great love wins great love&mdash;and there could
be no love greater than mine."</p>

<p>Still the beautiful face was averted. There was the sunlight
on the sea; the western wind sighed around them. A great
fear came over him. Surely, on this most fair and sunny day,
his love was not to meet a cruel death. His voice was so full
of this fear when he spoke again that she, in surprise, turned
and looked at him.</p>

<p>"Pauline," he cried, "you cannot mean to be cruel to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
I am no coward, but I would rather face death than your rejection."</p>

<p>Then it was that their eyes met; and that which he saw in
hers was a revelation to him. The next moment he had
clasped her to his heart, and was pouring out a torrent of passionate
words&mdash;such words, so tender, so loving, so full of passion
and hope, that her face grew pale as she listened, and the
beautiful figure trembled.</p>

<p>"I have frightened you, my darling," he said, suddenly.
"Ah! do forgive me. I was half mad with joy. You do not
know how I have longed to tell you this, yet feared&mdash;I knew
not what&mdash;you seemed so far above me, sweet. See, you are
trembling now! I am as cruel as a man who catches in his
hands a white dove that he has tamed, and hurts it by his grasp.
Sit down here and rest, while I tell you over and over again, in
every fashion, in every way, how I love you."</p>

<p>The sun never shone upon happier lovers than those. The
golden doors of Love's paradise were open to them.</p>

<p>"I never knew until now," said Vane, "how beautiful life is.
Why, Pauline, love is the very center of it; it is not money or
rank&mdash;it is love that makes life. Only to think, my darling,
that you and I may spend every hour of it together."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to the fair, calm heavens, and infinite
happiness filled her soul to overflowing; a deep, silent prayer
ascended unspoken from her heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sprang from his side with a startled cry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Vane!" she said, with outstretched hands, "I had forgotten
that I am unworthy. I can never marry you!"</p>

<p>He saw such wild despair in her face, such sudden, keen
anguish, that he was half startled; and, kneeling by her side,
he asked:</p>

<p>"Why, my darling? Tell me why. You, Pauline," he
cried&mdash;"you not worthy of me! My darling, what fancy is it&mdash;what
foolish idea&mdash;what freak of the imagination? You are
the noblest, the truest, the dearest woman in the whole wide
world! Pauline, why are you weeping so? My darling, trust
me&mdash;tell me."</p>

<p>She had shrunk shuddering from him, and had buried her
face in her hands; deep, bitter sobs came from her lips; there
was the very eloquence of despair in her attitude.</p>

<p>"Pauline," said her lover, "you cannot shake my faith in
you; you cannot make me think you have done wrong; but
will you try, sweet, to tell me what it is?"</p>

<p>He never forgot the despairing face raised to his, the shadow
of such unutterable sorrow in the dark eyes, the quivering of
the pale lips, the tears that rained down her face&mdash;it was such a
change from the radiant, happy girl of but a few minutes ago
that he could hardly believe it was the same Pauline.</p>

<p>He bent over her as though he would fain kiss away the fast
falling tears; but she shrank from him.</p>

<p>"Do not touch me, Vane!" she cried; "I am not worthy.
I had forgotten; in the happiness of loving you, and knowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
that I was beloved, I had forgotten it&mdash;my own deed has dishonored
me! We must part, for I am not worthy of you."</p>

<p>He took both her hands in his own, and his influence over
her was so great that even in that hour she obeyed him implicitly,
as though she had been a child.</p>

<p>"You must let me judge, Pauline," he said, gently. "You
are mine by right of the promise you gave me a few minutes
since&mdash;the promise to be my wife; that makes you mine&mdash;no
one can release you from it. By virtue of that promise you
must trust me, and tell me what you have done."</p>

<p>He saw that there was a desperate struggle in her mind&mdash;a
struggle between the pride that bade her rise in rebellion and
leave him with her secret untold, and the love that, bringing
with it sweet and gracious humility, prompted her to confess all
to him. He watched her with loving eyes; as that struggle
ended, so would her life take its shape.</p>

<p>He saw the dark eyes grow soft with good thoughts; he saw
the silent, proud defiance die out of the beautiful face; the lips
quivered, sweet humility seemed to fall over her and infold her.</p>

<p>"I have done a cruel deed, Vane," she said&mdash;"an act of
vengeance that cuts me off from the roll of noble women, and
dishonors me."</p>

<p>Still keeping his hold of the white hand, he said:</p>

<p>"Tell me what it was&mdash;I can judge far better than you."</p>

<p>It seemed to her fevered fancy that the song of the waves died
away, as though they were listening; that the wind fell with a
low sigh, and the birds ceased their song&mdash;a silence that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
almost terrible fell around her&mdash;the blue sky seemed nearer to
her.</p>

<p>"Speak to me, Vane!" she cried; "I am frightened!"</p>

<p>He drew her nearer to him.</p>

<p>"It is only fancy, my darling. When one has anything
weighty to say, it seems as though earth and sky were listening.
Look at me, think of me, and tell me all."</p>

<p>She could never remember how she began her story&mdash;how
she told him the whole history of her life&mdash;of the happy years
spent with her father in the Rue d'Orme, when she learned to
love art and nature, when she learned to love truth for its own
sake, and was brought up amid those kindly, simple-hearted
artist friends, with such bitter scorn, such utter contempt of all
conventionalities&mdash;of her keen and passionate sorrow when her
father died, and Sir Oswald took her home to Darrell Court,
telling her that her past life was at an end forever, and that even
the name she had inherited from her father must be changed for
the name of her race&mdash;how after a time she had grown to love
her home with a keen, passionate love, born of pride in her
race and in her name&mdash;of the fierce battle that raged always between
her stern, uncompromising truth and the worldly polish
Sir Oswald would have had her acquire.</p>

<p>She concealed nothing from him, telling him of her faults as
well as her trials. She gave him the whole history of Aubrey
Langton's wooing, and her contemptuous rejection of his suit.</p>

<p>"I was so proud, Vane," she said, humbly. "Heaven was
sure to punish me. I surrounded myself, as it were, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
barrier of pride, scorn, and contempt, and my pride has been
brought low."</p>

<p>She told him of Sir Oswald's anger at her refusal to marry
Aubrey, of her uncle's threat that he would marry and disinherit
her, of her scornful disbelief&mdash;there was no incident forgotten;
and then she came to the evening when Sir Oswald had
opened the box to take out the diamond ring, and had spoken
before them all of the roll of bank-notes placed there.</p>

<p>"That night, Vane," she said, "there was a strange unrest
upon me. I could not sleep. I have had the same sensation
when the air has been overcharged with electricity before a
storm; I seemed to hear strange noises, my heart beat, my face
was flushed and hot, every nerve seemed to thrill with pain. I
opened the window, thinking that the cool night air would drive
the fever from my brain.</p>

<p>"As I sat there in the profound silence, I heard, as plainly
as I hear myself speaking now, footsteps&mdash;quiet, stealthy footsteps&mdash;go
past my door.</p>

<p>"Let me explain to you that the library, where my uncle
kept his cash-box and his papers, is on the ground floor; on
the floor above that there are several guest-chambers. Captain
Langton slept in one of these. My uncle slept on the third
floor, and, in order to reach his room, was obliged to go
through the corridor where the rooms of Miss Hastings and
myself were.</p>

<p>"I heard those quiet, stealthy footsteps, Vane, and my heart
for a few moments beat painfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the Darrells were never cowards. I went to my door
and opened it gently. I could see to the very end of the corridor,
for at the end there was a large arched window, and a faint
gray light coming from it showed me a stealthy figure creeping
silently from Sir Oswald's room; the gray light showed me also
a glimmer of steel, and I knew, almost by instinct, that that
silent figure carried Sir Oswald's keys in its hands.</p>

<p>"In a moment I had taken my resolve. I pushed my door
to, but did not close it; I took off my slippers, lest they should
make a sound, and followed the figure down stairs. As I have
said before, the Darrells were never cowards; no dread came to
me; I was intent upon one thing&mdash;the detection of the wrongdoer.</p>

<p>"Not more than a minute passed while I was taking off my
shoes, but when I came to the foot of the grand staircase light
and figure had both disappeared. I cannot tell what impulse
led me to the library&mdash;perhaps the remembrance of Sir Oswald's
money being there came to me. I crossed the hall and opened
the library door.</p>

<p>"Though I had never liked Captain Langton, the scene that
was revealed to me came upon me as a shock&mdash;one that I shall
never forget. There was Captain Langton with my uncle's
cash-box before him, and the roll of bank-notes in his hand.
He looked up when I entered, and a terrible curse fell from his
lips&mdash;a frightful curse. His face was fearful to see. The room
lay in the shadow of dense darkness, save where the light he
carried shone like a faint star. The face it showed me was one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
I shall never forget; it was drawn, haggard, livid, with bloodless
lips and wild, glaring eyes.</p>

<p>"He laid the bank-notes down, and, going to the door,
closed it softly, turning the key; and then clutching my arm in
a grasp of iron, he hissed rather than said:</p>

<p>"'What fiend has brought you here?'</p>

<p>"He did not frighten me, Vane; I have never known fear.
But his eyes were full of murderous hate, and I had an idea
that he would have few scruples as to taking my life.</p>

<p>"'So, Captain Aubrey Langton,' I said, slowly, 'you are a
thief! You are robbing the old friend who has been so good
to you!'</p>

<p>"He dragged me to the table on which the money lay, and
then I saw a revolver lying there, too.</p>

<p>"'One word,' he hissed, 'one whisper above your breath,
and you shall die!'</p>

<p>"I know my face expressed no fear&mdash;nothing but scorn and
contempt&mdash;for his grew more livid as he watched me.</p>

<p>"'It is all your fault!' he hissed into my ear; 'it is your
accursed pride that has driven me to this! Why did you not
promise to marry me when my life lay in your hands?'</p>

<p>"I laughed&mdash;the idea of a Darrell married to this midnight
thief!</p>

<p>"'I told you I was a desperate man,' he went on. 'I
pleaded with you, I prayed to you, I laid my life at your feet,
and you trampled on it with scorn. I told you of my debts,
my difficulties, and you laughed at them. If I could have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
gone back to London betrothed to you, every city usurer would
have been willing to lend me money. I am driven to this, for
I cannot go back to face ruin. You have driven me to it; you
are the thief, though my hands take the money. Your thrice-accursed
pride has ruined me!'</p>

<p>"'I shall go to Sir Oswald,' I said, 'and wake him. You
shall not rob him!'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he returned, 'I shall. I defy you, I dare you; you
shall tell no one.'</p>

<p>"He took the revolver from the table and held it to my head;
I felt the cold steel touch my forehead.</p>

<p>"'Now,' he said, 'your life is in your own hands; you must
take an oath not to betray me, or I will fire.'</p>

<p>"'I am not afraid to die; I would rather die than hide such
sin as yours. You cannot frighten me; I shall call for assistance.'</p>

<p>"'Wait a moment,' he said, still keeping that cold steel to
my forehead, and still keeping his murderous eyes on my face;
'listen to what I shall do. The moment you cry out I shall
fire, and you will fall down dead&mdash;I told you I was a desperate
man. Before any one has time to come I shall place the bank-notes
in your hand, and afterward I shall tell Sir Oswald that,
hearing a noise in the library, and knowing money was kept
there, I hastened down, and finding a thief, I fired, not knowing
who it was&mdash;and you, being dead, cannot contradict me.'</p>

<p>"'You dare not be so wicked!' I cried.</p>

<p>"'I dare anything&mdash;I am a desperate man. I will do it, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the whole world will believe me; they will hold you a thief, but
they will believe me honest.'</p>

<p>"And, Vane, I knew that what he said was true; I knew that
if I chose death I should die in vain&mdash;that I should be branded
as a thief, who had been shot in the very act of stealing.</p>

<p>"'I will give you two minutes,' he said, 'and then, unless
you take an oath not to betray me, I will fire.'</p>

<p>"I was willing to lose my life, Vane," she continued, "but I
could not bear that all the world should brand me as a thief&mdash;I
could not bear that a Darrell should be reckoned among the
lowest of criminals. I vow to you it was no coward fear for my
life, no weak dread of death that forced the oath from my lips,
but it was a shrinking from being found dead there with Sir Oswald's
money in my hand&mdash;a shrinking from the thought that
they would come to look upon my face and say to each other,
'Who would have thought, with all her pride, that she was a
thief?' It was that word 'thief,' burning my brain, that conquered.</p>

<p>"'You have one minute more,' said the hissing whisper,
'and then, unless you take the oath&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'I will take it,' I replied; 'I do so, not to save my life, but
my fair name.'</p>

<p>"'It is well for you,' he returned; and then he forced me to
kneel, while he dictated to me the words of an oath so binding
and so fast that I dared not break it.</p>

<p>"Shuddering, sick at heart, wishing I had risked all and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
cried out for help, I repeated it, and then he laid the revolver
down.</p>

<p>"'You will not break that oath,' he said. 'The Darrells invariably
keep their word.'</p>

<p>"Then, coolly as though I had not been present, he put the
bank-notes into his pocket, and turned to me with a sneer.</p>

<p>"'You will wonder how I managed this,' he said. 'I am a
clever man, although you may not believe it. I drugged Sir
Oswald's wine, and while he slept soundly I took the keys from
under his pillow. I will put them back again. You seem so
horrified that you had better accompany me and see that I do
no harm to the old man.'</p>

<p>"He put away the box and extinguished the light. As we
stood together in the dense gloom, I felt his breath hot upon
my face.</p>

<p>"'There is no curse a man can invoke upon the woman who
has ruined him,' he said, 'that I do not give to you; but, remember,
I do not glory in my crime&mdash;I am ashamed of it.'</p>

<p>"In the darkness I groped my way to the door, and opened
it; in the darkness we passed through the hall where the armor
used by warriors of old hung, and in the darkness we went up
the broad staircase. I stood at the door of Sir Oswald's room
while Captain Langton replaced the keys, and then, without a
word, I went to my own chamber.</p>

<p>"Vane, I can never tell you of the storm, the tempest of
hate that raged within me. I could have killed myself for having
taken the oath. I could have killed Captain Langton for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
having extorted it. But there was no help for it then. Do you
think I did wrong in taking it?"</p>

<p>"No, my darling," he replied, "I do not. Few girls would
have been so brave. You are a heroine, Pauline."</p>

<p>"Hush!" she said, interrupting him. "You have not heard
all. I do not blame myself for acting as I did. I debated for
some time whether I ought to keep the oath or not. Every
good impulse of gratitude prompted me to break it; yet again
it seemed to me a cowardly thing to purchase my life by a lie.
Time passed on&mdash;the wonder all died away. I said to myself
that, if ever any one were falsely accused, I would speak out;
but such an event never happened; and not very long after, as
you know, Sir Oswald died. I did not like living under the
shadow of that secret&mdash;it robbed my life of all brightness. Captain
Langton came again. No words of mine can tell the contempt
in which I held him, the contempt with which I treated
him; every one noticed it, but he did not dare to complain.
He did dare, however, to offer me his hateful love again, and,
when I repulsed him in such a fashion as even he could not
overlook, he turned all his attention to Lady Darrell. I am a
wicked girl, Vane&mdash;now that the light of your love has revealed
so much to me, I can see how wicked. I have told you that I
had sworn to myself to be revenged on Lady Darrell for coming
between me and my inheritance. I have seen more of the
world since then, but at that time it seemed to me an unparalleled
thing that a young girl like her should marry an old man
like Sir Oswald entirely for his money. I told her if she did so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
I would be revenged. I know it was wrong," Pauline continued,
humbly; "at the time I thought it brave and heroic, now
I know it was wrong, and weak, and wicked&mdash;your love has
taught me that."</p>

<p>"It was an error that sprang from pride," he said, gently;
"there is nothing to part us."</p>

<p>"You have not heard all. Vane, I knew Captain Langton
to be a thief&mdash;to be a man who would not scruple at murder if
need required. I knew that all the love he could ever give to
any one he had given to me, yet I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, and the sad face raised humbly to his grew crimson
with a burning blush.</p>

<p>"Oh, Vane, how can I tell you the shameful truth? Knowing
what he was, knowing that he was going to marry Lady
Darrell, I yet withheld the truth. That was my revenge. I
knew he was a thief, a cruel, wicked slanderer, a thoroughly bad
man, yet, when one word from me would have saved her from
accepting his proposal, I, for my vengeance sake, refused to
speak that word."</p>

<p>Her voice died away in a low whisper; the very sound of her
words seemed to frighten her. Vane St. Lawrence's face grew
pale and stern.</p>

<p>"It was unworthy of you, Pauline," he said, unhesitatingly.
"It was a cruel revenge."</p>

<p>"I know it," she admitted. "No words can add to the keen
sense of my dishonor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me how it was," he said, more gently.</p>

<p>"I think," continued Pauline, "that she had always liked
Captain Langton. I remember that I used to think so before
she married my uncle. But she had noticed my contempt for
him. It shook her faith in him, and made her doubt him.
She came to me one day, Vane, with that doubt in her face and
in her words. She asked me to tell her if I knew anything
against him&mdash;if there was any reason why she should doubt
him. She asked me then, before she allowed herself to love
him; one word from me then would have saved her, and that
word, for my vengeance sake, I would not speak."</p>

<p>"It should have been spoken," observed Sir Vane, gravely.</p>

<p>"I know it. Captain Langton has no honor, no conscience.
He does not even like Lady Darrell; he will marry her solely
that he may have Darrell Court. He will afterward maltreat
her, and hold her life as nothing; he will squander the Darrell
property. Vane, as truly as the bright heaven shines above me,
I believe him to have no redeeming quality."</p>

<p>There was silence for some minutes, and then Sir Vane
asked:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Pauline&mdash;do you think that Lady Darrell would
marry him if she knew what you have just told me?"</p>

<p>"I am sure she would not. She is very worldly, and only
lives what one may call a life of appearances; she would not
marry him if she knew him to be a thief&mdash;she would shrink
from him. Elegant, polished, amiable women like Lady Darrell
are frightened at crime."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"That one word ought to have been spoken, Pauline, out of
sheer womanly pity and sheer womanly grace. How could
you refuse to speak when she came to you with a prayer on her
lips?"</p>

<p>"The pride and thirst for vengeance were too strong for me,"
she replied.</p>

<p>"And to these you have sacrificed the life and happiness of a
woman who has never really injured you. Lady Darrell and
Captain Langton are not yet married&mdash;are they, Pauline?"</p>

<p>"No, they are to be married in the spring," she answered.</p>

<p>"Then listen to me, my darling. This marriage must never
take place. Your silence is wicked&mdash;you cannot honorably and
conscientiously stand by and see Lady Darrell throw herself
away on a thief. You have done a grievous wrong, Pauline.
You must make a noble atonement."</p>

<p>Something like a gleam of hope came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Can I atone?" she asked. "I will do so if I know how,
even at the price of my life."</p>

<p>"I tell you, frankly," he said, "that you have done grievously
wrong. When that poor lady came to you in her doubt and
perplexity, you ought to have told her at least as much of the
truth as would have prevented the marriage. But, my darling,
this shall not part us. If I teach you how to atone will you
atone?"</p>

<p>She crossed her hands as one praying.</p>

<p>"I will do anything you tell me, Vane."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must go to Darrell Court, and you must make to Lady
Darrell the same ample avowal you have made to me; tell her
the same story&mdash;how you vowed vengeance against her, and
how you carried that vengeance out; and then see what comes
of it."</p>

<p>"But suppose she will not believe me&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"You will have done your best&mdash;you will at least have made
atonement for your secrecy. If, with her eyes open, Lady Darrell
marries Captain Langton after that, you will have nothing
to blame yourself for. It will be hard for you, my darling, but
it is the brave, right, true thing to do."</p>

<p>"And you do not hate me, Vane?"</p>

<p>"No; I love you even better than I did. The woman brave
enough to own her faults and desirous to atone for them deserves
all the love a man can give her. Pauline, when you
have done this, my darling, may I ask you when you will be my
wife?"</p>

<p>She sobbed out that she was unworthy&mdash;all unworthy; but
he would not even hear the words.</p>

<p>"None the less dear are you for having told me your faults.
There is only one word now, my darling, to keep in view; and
that is, 'atonement.'"</p>

<p>She looked up at him with happy, glistening eyes.</p>

<p>"Vane," she said, "I will go to Darrell Court to-morrow. I
shall never rest now until I have done what you wish me to
do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>So far had love redeemed her that she was ready to undo all
the wrong she had done, at any cost to her pride.</p>

<p>But love was to work even greater wonders for her yet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PAULINE AND LADY DARRELL.</div>


<p>Pauline communicated her resolution of going to Darrell
Court to Miss Hastings, and that lady looked up in surprise almost
too great for words.</p>

<p>"You are going to Darrell Court to-morrow!" she exclaimed.
"It cannot be, Pauline; you must not travel alone. If you
go, I must go with you."</p>

<p>But Pauline threw one arm caressingly round her friend's
neck.</p>

<p>"Do not try to stop me," she said, pleadingly, "and let me
go alone. I did a great wrong at Darrell Court, and I must return
to set it right. Only alone can I do that."</p>

<p>"Pauline," asked Miss Hastings, gravely, "do you wish to
atone for your revenge?"</p>

<p>"I do," she replied, simply. "You must let me go alone;
and when I come back I shall have something to tell you&mdash;something
that I know will please you very much."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Hastings kissed the beautiful face.</p>

<p>"It is as I thought," she said to herself&mdash;"in her case love
has worked wonders&mdash;it has redeemed her."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Lady Darrell sat alone in her dressing-room; the autumn
day was drawing to a close. Greatly to her delight and surprise,
Captain Langton had unexpectedly appeared that morning.
He knew that in the absence of Miss Hastings he could not
stop at Darrell Court; but he was paying a visit, he told Lady
Darrell, to Sir Peter Glynn, and hoped to see her every day.
He had declined dining at the Court, but promised to spend
some part of the evening there.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell had ordered an early dinner, and sat in her
dressing-room awaiting her maid. Of course she was going to
dress for the captain&mdash;to set off her delicate beauty to the greatest
advantage. A superb costume of pale pink brocade, with
rich trimmings of white lace, was ready for her. A suit of
pearls and opals lay in their open cases. The room presented a
picturesque appearance of unbounded and splendid confusion&mdash;lace,
jewelry, fans, slippers, all kinds of valuable and pretty
ornaments were there; but nothing in that room was one half
so fair as the beautiful woman who sat with a pleased smile
upon her face.</p>

<p>Yet there was something like a sigh on her lips. Did he love
her? Of her own feelings she had no doubt. She loved him
with her whole heart&mdash;as she had never imagined herself capable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of loving any one. But did he love her? There was
somewhat of coldness and indifference in his manner&mdash;something
she could not understand. He had greeted her carelessly&mdash;he
had bidden her a careless farewell, she said to herself.
Yet he must love her; for the face reflected in the mirror was a
very fair one.</p>

<p>Then she remembered Pauline, and the old wonder came
over her why Pauline had always such great, such unbounded
contempt for him.</p>

<p>Her maid came in, and Lady Darrell put on the pink brocade
with its white lace trimmings. The maid, in ecstasies, cried
out that it was superb&mdash;that "my lady" had "never looked so
beautiful."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell took up the pearl necklace and held it against
the pink brocade to note the contrast. While she held it in
her hands one of the servants gave a hurried rap at the door.
She came to announce that Miss Darrell had arrived suddenly,
and wished to see Lady Darrell at once.</p>

<p>"Miss Darrell! Then something must be the matter with
Miss Hastings. Ask her to come to me at once."</p>

<p>In a few moments Pauline was standing in that brilliant
room, looking pale and anxious.</p>

<p>"No," she said, in answer to Lady Darrell's eager question;
"there is nothing the matter with Miss Hastings. I wanted to
see you; I want to see you alone. Can you spare a few
minutes?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Darrell dismissed her maid, and then turned to Pauline.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked. "What has brought you here so
suddenly?"</p>

<p>Without one word, Pauline went to the door and locked it,
and then she went back to Lady Darrell, who was watching her
in wonder.</p>

<p>"I have done you a great wrong," she said, humbly, "and I
have come to atone for it."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell drew back, trembling with strange, vague fear.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pauline, Pauline, what have you done?"</p>

<p>Pauline threw aside her traveling cloak and took off her hat;
and then she came to Lady Darrell.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you my story, kneeling here," she said; and
she knelt down before Lady Darrell, looking as she spoke
straight into her face. "Let me tell you before I begin it,"
she added, "that I have no excuse to offer for myself&mdash;none.
I can only thank Heaven that I have seen my fault before&mdash;for
your sake&mdash;it is too late."</p>

<p>Slowly, gravely, sometimes with bitter tears and with sobs
that came from the depths of her heart, Pauline told her story&mdash;how
the captain had loved her, how ill he had taken her repulse,
how she had discovered his vile worthlessness, but for the
sake of her revenge had said nothing.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell listened as to her death-knell.</p>

<p>"Is this true, Pauline?" she cried. "You vowed vengeance
against me&mdash;is this your vengeance, to try to part me from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
man I love, and to take from me the only chance of happiness
that my wretched life holds?"</p>

<p>Her fair face had grown deadly pale; all the light and the
happiness had fled from it; the pearls lay unheeded, the blue
eyes grew dim with tears.</p>

<p>"Is it possible, Pauline?" she cried again. "Have I given
my love to one dishonored? I cannot believe it&mdash;I will not believe
it! It is part of your vengeance against me. What have
I done that you should hate me so?"</p>

<p>The dark eyes and the beautiful face were raised to hers.</p>

<p>"Dear Lady Darrell," said the girl, "I have never spoken a
loving word to you before; but I tell you now that, if I could
give my life to save you from this sorrow, I would do so."</p>

<p>"Aubrey Langton a thief!" cried Lady Darrell. "It is not
true&mdash;I will swear that it is not true! I love him, and you
want to take him from me. How could you dare to invent
such a falsehood of him, a soldier and a gentleman? You are
cruel and wicked."</p>

<p>Yet through all her passionate denials, through all her bitter
anger, there ran a shudder of deadly fear&mdash;a doubt that chilled
her with the coldness of death&mdash;a voice that would be heard,
crying out that here was no wrong, no falsehood, but the bare,
unvarnished truth. She cast it from her&mdash;she trampled it under
foot; and the girl kneeling at her feet suffered as much as she
did herself while she watched that struggle.</p>

<p>"You say that he would have murdered you&mdash;that he held a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
pistol to your forehead, and made you take that oath&mdash;he,
Aubrey Langton, did that?"</p>

<p>"He did!" said Pauline. "Would to Heaven I had told
you before."</p>

<p>"Would to Heaven you had!" she cried. "It is too late
now. I love him&mdash;I love him, and I cannot lose him. You
might have saved me from this, and you would not. Oh, cruel
and false!"</p>

<p>"Dearest Lady Darrell," said the girl, "I would wash out
my fault with my heart's blood if I could. There is no humiliation
that I would not undergo, no pain that I would not
suffer, to save you."</p>

<p>"You might have saved me. I had a doubt, and I went to
you, Pauline, humbly, not proudly. I prayed you to reveal
the truth, and you treated me with scorn. Can it be that one
woman could be so cruel to another? If you had but spoken
half the truth you have now told me, I should have believed
you, and have gone away; I should have crushed down the love
that was rising in my heart, and in time I should have forgotten
it. Now it is too late. I love him, and I cannot lose him&mdash;dear
Heaven, I cannot lose him!"</p>

<p>She flung up her arms with a wild cry of despair. None ever
suffered more than did Pauline Darrell then.</p>

<p>"Oh, my sin," she moaned, "my grievous sin!"</p>

<p>She tried to soothe the unhappy woman, but Lady Darrell
turned from her with all the energy of despair.</p>

<p>"I cannot believe you," she cried; "it is an infamous plot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
to destroy my happiness and to destroy me. Hark! There is
Aubrey Langton's voice; come with me and say before him
what you have said to me."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FACE TO FACE.</div>


<p>Captain Langton looked up in surprise not altogether unfounded,
the sight that met his eyes was so unusual.</p>

<p>Before him stood Lady Darrell, her face white as death, her
lips quivering with excitement, her superb dress of pink brocade
all disarranged, her golden hair falling over her beautiful shoulders&mdash;a
sight not to be forgotten; she held Pauline by the
hand, and in all her life Lady Darrell had never looked so agitated
as now.</p>

<p>"Captain Langton," said Lady Darrell, "will you come
here? I want you most particularly."</p>

<p>It was by pure chance that she opened the library door&mdash;it
was the one nearest to her.</p>

<p>"Will you follow me?" she said.</p>

<p>He looked from one to the other with somewhat of confusion
in his face.</p>

<p>"Miss Darrell!" he cried. "Why, I thought you were at
Omberleigh!"</p>

<p>Pauline made no reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Darrell held the library door open while they entered,
and then she closed it, and turned the key.</p>

<p>Captain Langton looked at her in wonder.</p>

<p>"Elinor," he said, "what does this mean? Are you going
to play a tragedy or a farce?"</p>

<p>"That will depend upon you," she answered; "I am glad
and thankful to have brought you and Miss Darrell face to face.
Now I shall know the truth."</p>

<p>The surprise on his face deepened into an angry scowl.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded, sharply. "I do not
understand."</p>

<p>It was a scene never to be forgotten. The library was dim
with the shadows of the autumn evening, and in the gloom
Lady Darrell's pale pink dress, golden hair, and white arms
bare to the shoulder, seemed to attract all the light; her face
was changed from its great agitation&mdash;the calm, fair beauty, the
gentle, caressing manner were gone.</p>

<p>Near her stood Pauline, whose countenance was softened with
compassion and pity unutterable, the dark eyes shining as
through a mist of tears.</p>

<p>Before them, as a criminal before his judges, stood Aubrey
Langton, with an angry scowl on his handsome face, and yet
something like fear in his eyes.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he cried, impatiently. "I cannot understand
this at all."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell turned her pale face to him.</p>

<p>"Captain Langton," she said, gravely, "Miss Darrell brings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
a terrible accusation against you. She tells me that you stole
the roll of notes that Sir Oswald missed, and that at the price of
her life you extorted an oath from her not to betray you; is it
true?"</p>

<p>She looked at him bravely, fearlessly.</p>

<p>"It is a lie!" he said.</p>

<p>Lady Darrell continued:</p>

<p>"Here, in this room, where we are standing now, she tells
me that the scene took place, and that, finding she had discovered
you in the very act of theft, you held a loaded pistol to
her head until she took the oath you dictated. Is it true or
false?"</p>

<p>"It is a lie!" he repeated; but his lips were growing white,
and great drops stood upon his brow.</p>

<p>"She tells me," resumed Lady Darrell, "that you loved her,
and that you care only for Darrell Court, not for me. Is it
true?"</p>

<p>"It is all false," he said, hoarsely&mdash;"false from beginning to
end! She hates you, she hates me, and this foul slander has
only been invented to part us!"</p>

<p>Lady Darrell looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Now Heaven help me!" she cried. "Which am I to believe?"</p>

<p>Grave and composed, with a certain majesty of truth that
could never be mistaken, Pauline raised her right hand.</p>

<p>"Lady Darrell," she said, "I swear to you, in the presence
of Heaven, that I have spoken nothing but the truth."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I swear it is false!" cried Aubrey Langton.</p>

<p>But appearances were against him; Lady Darrell saw that he
trembled, that his lips worked almost convulsively, and that
great drops stood upon his brow.</p>

<p>Pauline looked at him; those dark eyes that had in them no
shadow save of infinite pity and sorrow seemed to penetrate his
soul, and he shrank from the glance.</p>

<p>"Elinor," he cried, "you believe me, surely? Miss Darrell
has always hated you, and this is her revenge."</p>

<p>"Lady Darrell," said the girl, "I am ashamed of my hatred
and ashamed of my desire for vengeance. There is no humiliation
to which I would not submit to atone for my faults, but
every word I have said to you is true."</p>

<p>Once more with troubled eyes Lady Darrell looked from one
to the other; once more she murmured:</p>

<p>"Heaven help me! Which am I to believe?"</p>

<p>Then Captain Langton, with a light laugh, said:</p>

<p>"Is the farce ended, Lady Darrell? You see it is no tragedy
after all."</p>

<p>Pauline turned to him, and in the light of that noble face his
own grew mean and weak.</p>

<p>"Captain Langton," she said, "I appeal to whatever there is
of good and just in you. Own to the truth. You need not
be afraid of it&mdash;Lady Darrell will not injure you. She will
think better of you if you confess than if you deny. Tell her
that you were led into error, and trust to her kindness for
pardon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"She speaks well," observed Lady Darrell, slowly. "If you
are guilty, it is better to tell me so."</p>

<p>He laughed again, but the laugh was not pleasant to hear.
Pauline continued:</p>

<p>"Let the evil rest where it is, Captain Langton; do not
make it any greater. In your heart you know that you have no
love for this lady&mdash;it is her fortune that attracts you. If you
marry her, it will only be to make her unhappy for life. Admit
your fault and leave her in peace."</p>

<p>"You are a remarkably free-spoken young lady, Miss Darrell&mdash;you
have quite an oratorical flow of words. It is fortunate
that Lady Darrell knows you, or she might be tempted to believe
you. Elinor, I rest my claim on this&mdash;since you have
known Miss Darrell, have you ever received one act of kindness
from her, one kind word even?"</p>

<p>Lady Darrell was obliged to answer:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I leave it," he said, "to your sense of justice which
of us you are to believe now&mdash;her who, to anger you, swears to
my guilt, or me, who swears to my innocence? Elinor, my
love, you cannot doubt me."</p>

<p>Pauline saw her eyes soften with unutterable tenderness&mdash;he
saw a faint flush rise on the fair face. Almost involuntarily
Lady Darrell drew near to him.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear to doubt you, Aubrey," she said. "Oh,
speak the truth to me, for my love's sake!"</p>

<p>"I do speak the truth. Come with me; leave Miss Darrell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
for a while. Walk with me across the lawn, and I will tell you
what respect for Miss Darrell prevents my saying here."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell turned to Pauline.</p>

<p>"I must hear what he has to say&mdash;it is only just."</p>

<p>"I will wait for you," she replied.</p>

<p>The captain was always attentive; he went out into the hall
and returned with a shawl that he found there.</p>

<p>"You cannot go out with those beautiful arms uncovered,
Elinor," he said, gently.</p>

<p>He placed the shawl around her, trying to hide the coward,
trembling fear.</p>

<p>"As though I did not love you," he said, reproachfully.
"Show me another woman only half so fair."</p>

<p>Pauline made one more effort.</p>

<p>"Lady Darrell," she cried, with outstretched hands, "you
will not decide hastily&mdash;you will take time to judge?"</p>

<p>But as they passed out together, something in the delicate
face told her that her love for Aubrey Langton was the strongest
element in her nature.</p>

<p>"Lady Darrell," she cried again, "do not listen to him! I
swear I have told you the truth&mdash;Heaven will judge between
him and me if I have not!"</p>

<p>"You must have studied tragedy at the Porte St. Martin,"
said Aubrey Langton, with a forced laugh; "Lady Darrell
knows which to believe."</p>

<p>She watched them walk across the lawn, Captain Langton
pleading earnestly, Lady Darrell's face softening as she listened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am too late!" cried the girl, in an agony of self-reproach.
"All my humiliation is in vain; she will believe him and not
me. I cannot save her now, but one word spoken in time
might have done so."</p>

<p>Oh, the bitterness of the self-reproach that tortured her&mdash;the
anguish of knowing that she could have prevented Lady Darrell's
wrecking her whole life, yet had not done so! It was no
wonder that she buried her face in her hands, weeping and praying
as she had never wept and prayed in her life before.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Elinor, look at me," said Captain Langton; "do I look
like a thief and a would-be murderer?"</p>

<p>Out of Pauline's presence the handsome face had regained its
usual careless, debonair expression.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes, and he saw in them the lingering doubt,
the lingering fear.</p>

<p>"If all the world had turned against me," he said, "and had
refused to believe in me, you, Elinor, my promised wife, ought
to have had more faith."</p>

<p>She made no reply. There had been something in the
energy of Pauline's manner that carried conviction with it; and
the weak heart, the weak nature that had always relied upon
others, could form no decision unaided.</p>

<p>"For argument sake, let us reverse the case. Say that some
disappointed lover of yours came to tell to me that you had
been discovered stealing; should I not have laughed? Why,
Elinor, you must be blind not to see the truth; a child might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
discern it. The fact is that long ago I was foolish enough to
believe myself in love with Miss Darrell; and she&mdash;well, honestly
speaking, she is jealous. A gentleman does not like to
refer to such things, but that is the simple truth. She is jealous,
and would part us if she could; but she shall not. My beautiful
Elinor is all my own, and no half-crazed, jealous girl shall
come between us."</p>

<p>"Is it so, Aubrey?" asked Lady Darrell.</p>

<p>"My dearest Elinor, that is the whole secret of Miss Darrell's
strange conduct to me. She is jealous&mdash;and you know, I
should imagine, what jealous women are like."</p>

<p>She tried to believe him, but, when she recalled the noble
face, with its pure light of truth and pity, she doubted again.
But Captain Langton pleaded, prayed, invented such ridiculous
stories of Pauline, made such fervent protestations of love, lavished
such tender words upon her, that the weak heart turned
to him again, and again its doubtings were cast aside.</p>

<p>"How we shall laugh over this in the happy after years!" he
said. "It is really like a drama. Oh, Elinor, I am so thankful
that I was here to save you! And now, my darling, you are
trembling with cold. My fair, golden-haired Elinor, what must
you think of that cruel girl? How could she do it? No; I
will not go in again to-night&mdash;I should not be able to keep my
temper. Your grand tragedy heroine will be gone to-morrow."</p>

<p>They stood together under the shadow of the balcony, and he
drew her nearer to him.</p>

<p>"Elinor," he said, "I shall never rest again until you are my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
wife. This plot has failed; Miss Darrell will plot again to part
us. I cannot wait until the spring&mdash;you must be my wife before
then. To-morrow morning I shall ride over to talk to you
about it."</p>

<p>She clasped her arms round his neck, and raised her sweet
face to his.</p>

<p>"Aubrey," she said, wistfully, "you are not deceiving me?"</p>

<p>"No, my darling, I am not."</p>

<p>He bent down and kissed her lips. She looked at him again,
pleadingly, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Heaven will judge between us, Aubrey," she said, solemnly.
"I have a sure conviction that I shall know the truth."</p>

<p>"I hope Heaven will assist you," he returned, lightly; "I
am quite sure the decision will be in my favor."</p>

<p>And those words, so wickedly, so blasphemously false, were
the last he ever spoke to her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>DYING IN SIN.</div>


<p>Captain Langton left Lady Darrell at the door of the porch,
and went round to the stables. He was a man as utterly devoid
of principle as any man could well be, yet the untruths he had
told, the false testimony he had given, the false oaths he had
taken, had shaken his nerves.</p>

<p>"I should not care to go through such a scene as that again,"
he said&mdash;"to stand before two women as before my judges."</p>

<p>He found his hands unsteady and his limbs trembling; the
horse he had to ride was a spirited one. The captain half staggered
as he placed his hand on the saddle.</p>

<p>"I am not very well," he said to one of the grooms; "go to
the house and tell Frampton, the butler, to bring some brandy
here."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the butler appeared with a tray, on which
stood bottle and glass.</p>

<p>"This is some very old brandy, sir," he said, "and very
strong."</p>

<p>But Captain Langton did not appear to heed him; he poured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
out half a tumblerful and drank it, while the butler looked on
in amazement.</p>

<p>"It is very strong, sir," he repeated.</p>

<p>"I know what I am doing," returned the captain, with an
oath.</p>

<p>He was dizzy with fear and with his after-success; he shuddered
again as he mounted his horse, and the memory of Pauline's
face and Pauline's words came over him. Then he galloped
off, and Frampton, turning to the groom, with a scared
face, said:</p>

<p>"If he gets home safely after taking so much of that brandy,
and with that horse, I will never venture to say what I think
again."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Lady Darrell returned to the library, where she had left Pauline.
They looked at each other in silence, and then Lady
Darrell said:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I believe in him, Pauline; he cannot be what you say."</p>

<p>Miss Darrell rose and went up to her; she placed her in a
chair, and knelt at her feet.</p>

<p>"You do not believe what I have told you?" she questioned,
gently.</p>

<p>"I cannot; my love and my faith are all his."</p>

<p>"I have done my best," said Pauline, sorrowfully, "and I
can do no more. While I live I shall never forgive myself that
I did not speak sooner, Lady Darrell. Elinor, I shall kneel
here until you promise to forgive me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Lady Darrell looked at the beautiful face, with its expression
of humility.</p>

<p>"Pauline," she said, suddenly, "I hardly recognize you.
What has come to you? What has changed you?"</p>

<p>Her face crimson with hot blushes, Pauline answered her.</p>

<p>"It is to me," she said, "as though a vail had fallen from
before my eyes. I can see my sin in all its enormity. I can
see to what my silence has led, and, though you may not believe
me, I shall never rest until you say that you have forgiven me."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell was not a woman given to strong emotion of
any kind; the deepest passion of her life was her love for
Aubrey Langton; but even she could give some faint guess as
to what it had cost the proud, willful Pauline to undergo this
humiliation.</p>

<p>"I do forgive you," she said. "No matter how deeply you
have disliked me, or in what way you have plotted against me, I
cannot refuse you. I forgive you, Pauline."</p>

<p>Miss Darrell held up her face.</p>

<p>"Will you kiss me?" she asked. "I have never made that
request in all my life before, but I make it now."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell bent down and kissed her, while the gloom of
the evening fell round them and deepened into night.</p>

<p>"If I only knew what to believe!" Lady Darrell remarked.
"First my heart turns to him, Pauline, and then it turns to
you. Yet both cannot be right&mdash;one must be most wicked and
most false. You have truth in your face&mdash;he had truth on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
lips when he was talking to me. Oh, if I knew&mdash;if I only
knew!"</p>

<p>And when she had repeated this many times, Pauline said to
her:</p>

<p>"Leave it to Heaven; he has agreed that Heaven shall judge
between us, and it will. Whoever has told the lie shall perish
in it."</p>

<p>So some hours passed, and the change that had come over
Lady Darrell was almost pitiful to see. Her fair face was all
drawn and haggard, the brightness had all left it. It was as
though years of most bitter sorrow had passed over her. They
had spoken to her of taking some refreshment, but she had
sent it away. She could do nothing but pace up and down with
wearied step, moaning that she only wanted to know which was
right, which to believe, while Pauline sat by her in unwearied
patience. Suddenly Lady Darrell turned to her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with me?" she asked. "I cannot understand
myself; the air seems full of whispers and portents&mdash;it
is as though I were here awaiting some great event. What am
I waiting for?"</p>

<p>They were terrible words, for the answer to them was a great
commotion in the hall&mdash;the sound of hurried footsteps&mdash;of
many voices. Lady Darrell stood still in dismay.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she cried. "Oh, Pauline, I am full of fear&mdash;I
am sorely full of fear!"</p>

<p>It was Frampton who opened the door suddenly, and stood
before them with a white, scared face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my lady&mdash;my lady!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Tell her quickly," cried Pauline; "do you not see that
suspense is dangerous?"</p>

<p>"One of the Court servants," said the butler, at once, in response,
"returning from Audleigh Royal, has found the body
of Captain Langton lying in the high-road, where his horse had
thrown him, dragged him, and left him&mdash;dead!"</p>

<p>"Heaven be merciful to him!" cried Pauline Darrell. "He
has died in his sin."</p>

<p>But Lady Darrell spoke no words. Perhaps she thought to
herself that Heaven had indeed judged between them. She
said nothing&mdash;she trembled&mdash;a gasping cry came from her, and
she fell face forward on the floor.</p>

<p>They raised her and carried her up stairs. Pauline never left
her; through the long night-watches and the long days she kept
her place by her side, while life and death fought fiercely for
her. She would awake from her stupor at times, only to ask
about Aubrey&mdash;if it could be true that he was dead&mdash;and then
seemed thankful that she could understand no more.</p>

<p>They did not think at first that she could recover. Afterward
Doctor Helmstone told her that she owed her life to Pauline
Darrell's unchanging love and care.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE WORK OF ATONEMENT.</div>


<p>The little town of Audleigh Royal had never been so excited.
It was such a terrible accident. Captain Langton, the guest of
Sir Peter Glynn, so soon to be master of Darrell Court&mdash;a man
so handsome, so accomplished, and so universal a favorite&mdash;to
be killed in the gloom of an autumn night, on the high-road!
Society was grieved and shocked.</p>

<p>"That beautiful young lady at the Hall, who loved him so
dearly, was," people whispered to each other, "at death's door&mdash;so
deep was her grief."</p>

<p>An inquest was held at the "Darrell Arms;" and all the
revelations ever made as to the cause of Captain Langton's death
were made then. The butler and the groom at Darrell Court
swore to having felt some little alarm at seeing the deceased
drink more than half a tumblerful of brandy. The butler's
prophecy that he would never reach home in safety was repeated.
One of the men said that the captain looked pale and scared,
as though he had seen a ghost; another told how madly he had
galloped away; so that no other conclusion could be come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
but this&mdash;that he had ridden recklessly, lost all control over the
horse, and had been thrown. There was proof that the animal
had dragged him along the road for some little distance; and it
was supposed the fatal wound had been inflicted when his head
was dashed against the mile-stone close to which he had been
found.</p>

<p>It was very shocking, very terrible. Society was distressed.
The body lay at the "Darrell Arms" until all arrangements had
been made for the funeral. Such a funeral had never been seen
in Audleigh Royal. Rich and poor, every one attended.</p>

<p>Captain Langton was buried in the pretty little cemetery at
Audleigh; and people, as they stood round the grave, whispered
to each other that, although the horse that killed him had cost
over a hundred pounds, Sir Peter Glynn had ordered it to be
shot.</p>

<p>Then, when the autumn had faded into winter, the accident
was forgotten. Something else happened which drove it from
people's minds, and the tragedy of Audleigh Royal became a
thing of the past.</p>

<p>Pauline did not return to Omberleigh. Miss Hastings was
dreadfully shocked when she received a letter telling her of Captain
Langton's death and of Lady Darrell's serious illness. No
persuasions could induce her to remain longer away. She returned
that same day to the Court, and insisted upon taking her
share in the nursing of Lady Darrell.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton looked upon the captain's accident as the
direct interposition of Providence. Of course such a death was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
very shocking, very terrible; but certainly it had never been a
match she approved; and, after all, say what one would, everything
had happened for the best.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton went over to Darrell Court, and assisted in
attending to the invalid; but her thoughts ran more on Lord
Aynsley, and the chances of his renewing his offer, than on anything
else. Elinor would soon recover, there was no fear; the
shock to her nerves had been great, but people never died of
nervousness; and, when she did get well, Lady Hampton intended
to propose a season in London.</p>

<p>But Lady Darrell did not get well as soon as Lady Hampton
had anticipated. Indeed, more than one clever doctor, on leaving
her presence, shook his head gravely, and said it was doubtful
whether Lady Darrell would ever recover at all; the shock
to her nerves had been terrible.</p>

<p>But there was something to be said also of a blighted life and
a broken heart.</p>

<p>Autumn had drifted into winter; and one morning Lady
Darrell, who had been sleeping more soundly than usual, suddenly
turned to Pauline, who seldom left her.</p>

<p>"Pauline," she whispered, "you have not told any one, have
you?"</p>

<p>"Told what?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"About poor Aubrey's faults. I know now that he was
guilty. Strange, solemn thoughts, strange revelations, come to
us, are made to us in sickness, when we lie, where I have been
lying, in the valley of the shadow of death. I know that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
was guilty, and that he died in his sin. I know it now, Pauline."</p>

<p>Miss Darrell bent over her and kissed the white brow.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, dear," continued the weak voice. "Let this
secret die with us&mdash;let there be a bond between us never to reveal
it. You will never tell any one about it, will you, Pauline?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "never. I should never have told you
but that I hoped to save you from a dreadful fate&mdash;and it would
have been a dreadful fate for you to have married him; he would
have broken your heart."</p>

<p>"It is broken now," she said, gently. "Yet it comforts me
to know that no reproach will be heaped on Aubrey's memory."</p>

<p>"You will get better," observed Pauline, hopefully, "and
then there will be happier days in store for you."</p>

<p>"There will be no happy days for me," returned Lady Darrell,
sorrowfully. "You see, Pauline, I loved him very dearly&mdash;more
dearly than I knew. I had never loved any one very
much until I saw him. I could more easily have checked a
raging fire than have restrained my love after I had once given
it. My life had in some way passed into his, and now I do not
care to live."</p>

<p>"But you have so much to live for," said Pauline.</p>

<p>"Not now. I do not care for aught about me. I have tried
to remember Darrell Court and all my wealth and grandeur,
but they give me no pleasure&mdash;the shadow of death lies over
all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>And it was all in vain that Pauline tried to rouse her; Lady
Darrell, after her unhappy love, never cared to be roused again.
Lady Hampton would not think seriously of her illness&mdash;it
would pass away in time, she said; but Miss Hastings shook
her head gravely, and feared the worst.</p>

<p>The time came when Pauline told some part of her story to
the governess. She did not mention Aubrey's crime&mdash;that
secret she kept until death&mdash;but she gave a sketch of what had
passed between her and Lady Darrell.</p>

<p>"Did I do right?" she asked, with that sweet humility which
had vanquished all pride in her.</p>

<p>"You acted worthily," replied Miss Hastings, while she marveled
at the transformation which love had wrought in that
once proud, willful girl.</p>

<p>Time passed on, and by the wish of Miss Hastings a celebrated
physician was sent for from London, for Lady Darrell
grew no better. His opinion sounded somewhat like a death-warrant.</p>

<p>"She may recover sufficiently to quit her room and to linger
on in life&mdash;how long is uncertain; but the shock to her nerves
she will never fully recover from&mdash;while she lives she will be a
victim to nervousness. But I do not think she will live long.
Let her have as much cheerful society as possible, without
fatigue; nothing more can be done for her."</p>

<p>And with that they were obliged to be content. Lady Hampton
would not admit that the London physician was correct.</p>

<p>"Nerves are all nonsense," she said, brusquely. "How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
many nervous shocks have I been through, with husband dead
and children dead? Elinor's only danger is her mother's complaint.
She died of consumption quite young."</p>

<p>It was found, however, despite Lady Hampton's disbelief,
that the London physician had spoken truthfully. Lady Darrell
rose from her sick bed, but she was but the shadow of herself,
and a victim to a terrible nervous disorder.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings watched over her with great anxiety, but Pauline
was like a second self to the unhappy lady. They were
speaking of her one day, and Miss Hastings said:</p>

<p>"An illness like Lady Darrell's is so uncertain, Pauline; you
must not occupy yourself with her so entirely, or you will lose
your own health."</p>

<p>But Pauline looked up with a smile&mdash;perhaps the gravest, the
sweetest and most tender her face had ever worn.</p>

<p>"I shall never leave her," she returned.</p>

<p>"Never leave her?" questioned Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>"No. I shall stay with her to comfort her while life lasts,
and that will be my atonement."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LOVE AND SORROW.</div>


<p>The beautiful golden summer came round, and Darrell Court
looked picturesque and lovely with its richness of foliage and
flush of flowers. The great magnolia trees were all in bloom&mdash;the
air was full of their delicate, subtle perfume; the chestnuts
were in bloom, the limes all in blossom. Sweet summer
had scattered her treasures with no niggard hand; and Lady
Darrell had lived to see the earth rejoice once more.</p>

<p>Under the limes, where the shadows of the graceful, tremulous,
scented leaves fell on the grass&mdash;the limes that were never
still, but always responding to some half-hidden whisper of the
wind&mdash;stood Pauline Darrell and her lover, Sir Vane St. Lawrence.
They had met but once since their hurried parting at
Omberleigh. Vane had been to Darrell Court&mdash;for their engagement
was no secret now. They wrote to each other constantly.</p>

<p>On this fair June day Sir Vane had come to the Court with
news that stirred the depths of the girl's heart as a fierce wind
stirs the ripples on a lake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>As the sunlight fell through the green leaves and rested on
her, the change in her was wonderful to see. The beautiful,
noble face had lost all its pride, all its defiance; the play of the
lips was tremulous, sensitive, and gentle; the light in the dark
eyes was of love and kindness. Time had added to her loveliness;
the grand, statuesque figure had developed more perfectly;
the graceful attitudes, the unconscious harmony, the indefinable
grace and fascination were more apparent than ever.
But she no longer carried her grand beauty as a protest, but
made it rather the crown of a pure and perfect womanhood.</p>

<p>Something dimmed the brightness of her face, for Sir Vane
had come to her with strange news and a strange prayer. His
arm was clasped round her as they walked under the shadow of
the limes where lovers' footsteps had so often strayed.</p>

<p>"Yes, Pauline, it has come so unexpectedly at last," spoke
Sir Vane. "Ever since Graveton has been in office, my dear
mother has been unwearied in asking for an appointment for
me. You know the story of our impoverished fortunes, and
how anxious my dear mother is to retrieve them."</p>

<p>Her hand seemed to tighten its clasp on his, as she answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"Now an opportunity has come. Graveton, in answer to my
mother's continued requests, has found for me a most lucrative
office; but, alas, my love, it is in India, and I must shortly set
out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>"In India!" repeated Pauline; "and you must set out
shortly, Vane? How soon?"</p>

<p>"In a fortnight from now," he answered. "It is an office
that requires filling up at once, Pauline. I have come to ask if
you will accompany me? Will you pardon the short notice,
and let me take my wife with me to that far-off land? Do not
let me go alone into exile&mdash;come with me, darling."</p>

<p>The color and light died out of her beautiful face, her lips
quivered, and her eyes grew dim as with unshed tears.</p>

<p>"I cannot," she replied; and there was a silence between
them that seemed full of pain.</p>

<p>"You cannot, Pauline!" he cried, and the sadness and disappointment
in his voice made her lips quiver again. "Surely
you will not allow any feminine nonsense about dress and preparations,
any scruple about the shortness of time, to come between
us? My mother bade me say that if you will consent
she will busy herself night and day to help us to prepare. She
bade me add her prayer to mine. Oh, Pauline, why do you
say you cannot accompany me?"</p>

<p>The first shock had passed for her, and she raised her noble
face to his.</p>

<p>"From no nonsense, Vane," she said. "You should know
me better, dear, than that. Nothing can part us but one thing.
Were it not for that, I would go with you to the very end of the
world&mdash;I would work for you and with you."</p>

<p>"But what is it, Pauline?" he asked. "What is it, my
darling?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>She clung to him more closely still.</p>

<p>"I cannot leave her, Vane&mdash;I cannot leave Lady Darrell.
She is dying slowly&mdash;hour by hour, day by day&mdash;and I cannot
leave her."</p>

<p>"But, my darling Pauline, there are others beside you to attend
to the lady&mdash;Lady Hampton and Miss Hastings. Why
should you give up your life thus?"</p>

<p>"Why?" she repeated. "You know why, Vane. It is the
only atonement I can offer her. Heaven knows how gladly,
how happily, I would this moment place my hand in yours and
accompany you; my heart longs to do so. You are all I have
in the world, and how I love you you know, Vane. But it
seems to me that I owe Lady Darrell this reparation, and at the
price of my whole life's happiness I must make it."</p>

<p>He drew her nearer to him, and kissed the trembling lips.</p>

<p>"She has suffered so much, Vane, through me&mdash;all through
me. If I had but foregone my cruel vengeance, and when she
came to me with doubt in her heart if I had but spoken one
word, the chances are that by this time she would have been
Lady Aynsley, and I should have been free to accompany you,
my beloved; but I must suffer for my sin. I ought to suffer,
and I ought to atone to her."</p>

<p>"Your life, my darling," he said, "your beautiful bright life,
your love, your happiness, will all be sacrificed."</p>

<p>"They must be. You see, Vane, she clings to me in her
sorrow. His name&mdash;Aubrey Langton's name&mdash;never passes her
lips to any one else but me. She talks of him the night and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the day through&mdash;it is the only comfort she has; and then she
likes me to be with her, to talk to her, and soothe her, and she
tires so soon of any one else. I cannot leave her, Vane&mdash;it
would shorten her life, I am sure."</p>

<p>He made no answer. She looked up at him with tearful
eyes.</p>

<p>"Speak to me, Vane. It is hard, I know&mdash;but tell me that
I am right."</p>

<p>"You are cruelly right," he replied. "Oh, my darling, it is
very hard! Yet you make her a noble atonement for the wrong
you have done&mdash;a noble reparation. My darling, is this how
your vow of vengeance has ended&mdash;in the greatest sacrifice a
woman could make."</p>

<p>"Your love has saved me," she said, gently&mdash;"has shown
me what is right and what is wrong&mdash;has cleared the mist from
my eyes. But for that&mdash;oh, Vane, I hate to think what I
should have been!"</p>

<p>"I wish it were possible to give up the appointment," he remarked,
musingly.</p>

<p>"I would not have you do it, Vane. Think of Lady St.
Lawrence&mdash;how she has worked for it. Remember, it is your
only chance of ever being what she wishes to see you. You
must not give it up."</p>

<p>"But how can I leave you, Pauline?"</p>

<p>"If you remain in England, it will make but little difference,"
she said. "I can never leave Lady Darrell while she
lives."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Pauline, it may be four, five, or six years before I return,
and all that time I shall never see you."</p>

<p>She wrung her hands, but no murmur passed her lips, save
that it was her fault&mdash;all her fault&mdash;the price of her sin.</p>

<p>"Vane," she said, "you must not tell Lady Darrell what you
came to ask me. She must know that you are here only to say
good-by. I would rather keep her in ignorance; she will be
the happier for not knowing."</p>

<p>Was ever anything seen like that love and that sorrow&mdash;the
love of two noble souls, two noble hearts, and the sorrow that
parting more bitter than death brought upon them? Even
Miss Hastings did not know until long after Sir Vane was gone
of the sacrifice Pauline had made in the brave endeavor to
atone for her sin.</p>

<p>She never forgot the agony of that parting&mdash;how Sir Vane
stood before them, pale, worn, and sad, impressing one thing
on them all&mdash;care for his darling. Even to Lady Darrell, the
frail, delicate invalid, whose feeble stock of strength seemed to
be derived from Pauline, he gave many charges.</p>

<p>"It will be so long before I see her again," he said; "but
you will keep her safely for me."</p>

<p>"I almost wonder," said Lady Darrell, "why you do not ask
Pauline to accompany you, Sir Vane. For my own sake, I am
most selfishly glad that you have not done so&mdash;I should soon
die without her."</p>

<p>They looked at each other, the two who were giving up so
much for her, but spoke no word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Vane was obliged to return to London that same day.
He spoke of seeing Pauline again, but she objected&mdash;it would
only be a renewal of most bitter and hopeless sorrow. So they
bade each other farewell under the lime trees. The bitter yet
sweet memory of it lasted them for life.</p>

<p>Miss Hastings understood somewhat of the pain it would
cause, but with her gentle consideration, she thought it best to
leave Pauline for a time. Hours afterward she went in search
of her, and found her under the limes, weeping and moaning
for the atonement she had made for her sin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LADY DARRELL'S WILL.</div>


<p>Two years passed away, and Sir Vane St. Lawrence's circumstances
were rapidly improving; his letters were constant and
cheerful&mdash;he spoke always of the time when he should come
home and claim Pauline for his wife. She only sighed as she
read the hopeful words, for she had resolved that duty should
be her watchword while Lady Darrell lived&mdash;even should that
frail, feeble life last for fifty years, she would never leave her.</p>

<p>There came to her chill doubts and fears, dim, vague forebodings
that she should never see Vane again&mdash;that their last
parting was for ever; not that she doubted him, but that it
seemed hopeless to think he would wait until her hair was gray,
and the light of her youth had left her.</p>

<p>Never mind&mdash;she had done her duty; she had sinned, but
she had made the noblest atonement possible for her sin.</p>

<p>Two years had passed, and the summer was drawing to a
close. To those who loved and tended her it seemed that Lady
Darrell's life was closing with it. Even Lady Hampton had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
ceased to speak hopefully, and Darrell Court was gloomy with
the shadow of the angel of death.</p>

<p>There came an evening when earth was very lovely&mdash;when
the gold of the setting sun, the breath of the western wind, the
fragrance of the flowers, the ripple of the fountains, the song of
the birds, were all beautiful beyond words to tell; and Lady
Darrell, who had lain watching the smiling summer heavens,
said:</p>

<p>"I should like once more to see the sun set, Pauline. I
should like to sit at the window, and watch the moon rise."</p>

<p>"So you shall," responded Pauline. "You are a fairy queen.
You have but to wish, and the wish is granted."</p>

<p>Lady Darrell smiled&mdash;no one ever made her smile except
Pauline; but the fulfillment of the wish was not so easy after
all. Lady Hampton's foreboding was realized. Lady Darrell
might have recovered from her long, serious illness but that her
mother's complaint, the deadly inheritance of consumption, had
seized upon her, and was gradually destroying her.</p>

<p>It was no easy matter now to dress the wasted figure; but
Pauline seemed to have the strength, the energy of twenty
nurses. She was always willing, always cheerful, always ready;
night and day seemed alike to her; she would look at her
hands, and say:</p>

<p>"Oh! Elinor, I wish I could give you one-half my strength&mdash;one-half
my life!"</p>

<p>"Do you? Pauline, if you could give me half your life,
would you do so?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"As willingly as I am now speaking to you," she would
answer.</p>

<p>They dressed the poor lady, whose delicate beauty had faded
like some summer flower. She sat at the window in a soft nest
of cushions which Pauline had prepared for her, her wasted
hands folded, her worn face brightened with the summer sunshine.
She was very silent and thoughtful for some time, and
then Pauline, fearing that she was dull, knelt in the fashion that
was usual to her at Lady Darrell's feet, and held the wasted
hands in hers.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about, Elinor?" Pauline asked.
"Something as bright as the sunshine?"</p>

<p>Lady Darrell smiled.</p>

<p>"I was just fancying to myself that every blossom of that
white magnolia seemed like a finger beckoning me away," she
said; "and I was thinking also how full of mistakes life is, and
how plainly they can be seen when we come to die."</p>

<p>Pauline kissed the thin fingers. Lady Darrell went on.</p>

<p>"I can see my own great mistake, Pauline. I should not
have married Sir Oswald. I had no love for him&mdash;not the least
in the world; I married him only for position and fortune. I
should have taken your warning, and not have come between
your uncle and you. His resentment would have died away,
for I am quite sure that in his heart he loved you; he would
have forgiven you, and I should have had a happier, longer life.
That was my mistake&mdash;my one great mistake. Another was
that I had a certain kind of doubt about poor Aubrey. I cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
explain it; but I know that I doubted him even when I
loved him, and I should have waited some time before placing
the whole happiness of my life in his hands. Yet it seems hard
to pay for those mistakes with my life, does it not?"</p>

<p>And Pauline, to whom all sweet and womanly tenderness
seemed to come by instinct, soothed Lady Darrell with loving
words until she smiled again.</p>

<p>"Pauline," she said, suddenly, "I wish to communicate
something to you. I wish to tell you that I have made my will,
and have left Darrell Court to you, together with all the fortune
Sir Oswald left me. I took your inheritance from you once,
dear; now I restore it to you. I have left my aunt, Lady
Hampton, a thousand a year; you will not mind that&mdash;it
comes back to you at her death."</p>

<p>"I do not deserve your kindness," said Pauline, gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do; and you will do better with your uncle's
wealth than I have done. I have only been dead in life. My
heart was broken&mdash;and I have had no strength, no energy. I
have done literally nothing; but you will act differently, Pauline&mdash;you
are a true Darrell, and you will keep up the true
traditions of your race. In my poor, feeble hands they have all
fallen through. If Sir Vane returns, you will marry him; and,
oh! my darling, I wish you a happy life. As for me, I shall
never see the sun set again."</p>

<p>The feeble voice died away in a tempest of tears; and Pauline,
frightened, made haste to speak of something else to
change the current of her thoughts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>But Lady Darrell was right. She never saw the sun set or
the moon rise again&mdash;the frail life ended gently as a child falls
asleep. She died the next day, when the sun was shining its
brightest at noon; and her death was so calm that they thought
it sleep.</p>

<p>She was buried, not in the Darrell vault, but, by Pauline's
desire, in the pretty cemetery at Audleigh Royal. Her death
proved no shock, for every one had expected it. Universal
sympathy and kindness followed her to her grave. The short
life was ended, and its annals were written in sand.</p>

<p>Lady Hampton had given way; her old dislike of Pauline
had changed into deep admiration of her sweet, womanly virtues,
her graceful humility.</p>

<p>"If any one had ever told me," she said, "that Pauline Darrell
would have turned out as she has, I could not have believed
it. The way in which she devoted herself to my niece was
wonderful. I can only say that in my opinion she deserves
Darrell Court."</p>

<p>The legacy made Lady Hampton very happy; it increased
her income so handsomely that she resolved to live no longer at
the Elms, but to return to London, where the happiest part of
her life had been spent.</p>

<p>"I shall come to Darrell Court occasionally," she said, "so
that you may not quite forget me;" and Pauline was surprised
to find that she felt nothing save regret at parting with one
whom she had disliked with all the injustice of youth.</p>

<p>A few months afterward came a still greater surprise. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
lover from whom Miss Hastings had been parted in her early
youth&mdash;who had left England for Russia long years ago, and
whom she had believed dead&mdash;returned to England, and never
rested until he had found his lost love.</p>

<p>In vain the gentle, kind-hearted lady protested that she was
too old to marry&mdash;that she had given up all thoughts of love.
Mr. Bereton would not hear of it, and Pauline added her entreaties
to his.</p>

<p>"But I cannot leave you, my dear," said Miss Hastings.
"You cannot live all by yourself."</p>

<p>"I shall most probably have to spend my life alone," she
replied, "and I will not have your happiness sacrificed to
mine."</p>

<p>Between her lover and her pupil Miss Hastings found all resistance
hopeless. Pauline took a positive delight and pleasure
in the preparations for the marriage, and, in spite of all that
Miss Hastings could say to the contrary, she insisted upon settling
a very handsome income upon her.</p>

<p>There was a tone of sadness in all that Pauline said with
reference to her future which struck Miss Hastings with wonder.</p>

<p>"You never speak of your own marriage," she said, "or
your own future&mdash;why is it, Pauline?"</p>

<p>The beautiful face was overshadowed for a moment, and then
she replied:</p>

<p>"It is because I have no hope. I had a presentiment when
Vane went away, that I should not see him again. There are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
some strange thoughts always haunting me. If I reap as I have
sowed, what then?"</p>

<p>"My dear child, no one could do more than you have done.
You repented of your fault, and atoned for it in the best way
you were able."</p>

<p>But the lovely face only grew more sad.</p>

<p>"I was so willful, so proud, so scornful. I did not deserve
a happy life. I am trying to forget all the romance and the
love, all the poetry of my youth, and to live only for my duty."</p>

<p>"But Sir Vane will come back," said Miss Hastings.</p>

<p>"I do not know&mdash;all hope seemed to die in my heart when
he went away. But let us talk of you and your future without
reference to mine."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Miss Hastings was married, and after she had gone away
Pauline Darrell was left alone with her inheritance at last.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SHADOW OF ABSENT LOVE.</div>


<p>Six years had passed since the marriage of the governess left
Miss Darrell alone. She heard as constantly as ever from Sir
Vane; he had made money rapidly. It was no longer the desire
to make a fortune which kept him away, but the fact that
in the part of the country where he was great danger existed,
and that, having been placed there in a situation of trust, he
could not well leave it; so of late a hopeless tone had crept
into his letters. He made no reference to coming home; and
Pauline, so quick, so sensitive, saw in this reticence the shadow
of her own presentiment.</p>

<p>Six years had changed Pauline Darrell from a beautiful girl
to a magnificent woman; her beauty was of that grand and
queenly kind that of itself is a noble dowry. The years had
but added to it. They had given a more statuesque grace to
the perfect figure; they had added tenderness, thought, and
spirituality to the face; they had given to her beauty a charm
that it had never worn in her younger days.</p>

<p>Miss Darrell, of Darrell Court, had made for herself a wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
reputation. There was no estate in England so well
managed as hers. From one end to the other the Darrell
domain was, people said, a garden. Pauline had done away
with the old cottages and ill-drained farm-houses, and in their
stead pretty and commodious buildings had been erected. She
had fought a long and fierce battle with ignorance and prejudice,
and she had won.</p>

<p>She had established schools where children were taught, first
to be good Christians, and then good citizens, and where useful
knowledge was made much of. She had erected almshouses
for the poor, and a church where rich and poor, old and young,
could worship God together. The people about her rose up
and called her blessed; tenants, dependents, servants, all had
but one word for her, and that was of highest praise. To do
good seemed the object of her life, and she had succeeded so
far.</p>

<p>No young queen was ever more popular or more beloved
than this lady with her sweet, grave smile, her tender, womanly
ways, her unconscious grandeur of life. She made no stir, no
demonstration, though she was the head of a grand old race,
the representative of an old honored family, the holder of a
great inheritance; she simply did her duty as nobly as she knew
how to do it. There was no thought of self left in her, her
whole energies were directed for the good of others. If Sir Oswald
could have known how the home he loved was cared for,
he would have been proud of his successor. The hall itself,
the park, the grounds, were all in perfect order. People wondered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
how it was all arranged by this lady, who never seemed
hurried nor talked of the work she did.</p>

<p>Pauline occupied herself incessantly, for the bright hopes of
girlhood, she felt, were hers no longer; she had admitted that
the romance, the passion, the poetry of her youth were unforgotten,
but she tried to think them dead. People wondered at
her gravity. She had many admirers, but she never showed the
least partiality for any of them. There seemed to be some
shadow over her, and only those who knew her story knew what
it was&mdash;that it was the shadow of her absent love.</p>

<p>She was standing one day in the library alone, the same
library where so much of what had been eventful in her life
had happened. The morning had been a busy one; tenants,
agents, business people of all kinds had been there, and Pauline
felt tired.</p>

<p>Darrell Court, the grand inheritance she had loved and in
some measure longed for, was hers; she was richer than she
had ever dreamed of being, and, as she looked round on the
treasures collected in the library, she thought to herself with a
sigh, "Of what avail are they, save to make others happy?"
She would have given them all to be by Vane's side, no matter
how great their poverty, no matter what they had to undergo
together; but now it seemed that this bright young love of
hers was to wither away, to be heard of no more.</p>

<p>So from the beautiful lips came a deep sigh; she was tired,
wearied with the work and incessant care that the management
of her estates entailed. She did not own it even to herself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
but she longed for the presence of the only being whom she
loved.</p>

<p>She was bending over some beautiful japonicas&mdash;for, no matter
how depressed she might be, she always found solace in
flowers&mdash;when she heard the sound of a horse's rapid trot.</p>

<p>"Farmer Bowman back again," she said to herself, with a
smile; "but I must not give way to him."</p>

<p>She was so certain that it was her tiresome tenant that she did
not even turn her head when the door opened and some one
entered the room&mdash;some one who did not speak, but who went
up to her with a beating heart, laid one hand on her bowed
head, and said:</p>

<p>"Pauline, my darling, you have no word of welcome for
me?"</p>

<p>It was Vane. With a glad cry of welcome&mdash;a cry such as a
lost child gives when it reaches its mother's arms&mdash;the cry of a
long-cherished, trusting love&mdash;she turned and was clasped in his
arms, her haven of rest, her safe refuge, her earthly paradise,
attained at last.</p>

<p>"At last!" she murmured.</p>

<p>But he spoke no word to her. His eyes were noting her increased
beauty. He kissed the sweet lips, the lovely face.</p>

<p>"My darling," he said, "I left you a beautiful girl, but I find
you a woman beautiful beyond all comparison. It has seemed
to me an age since I left you, and now I am never to go away
again. Pauline, you will be kind to me for the sake of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
long, true, deep love? You will be my wife as soon as I can
make arrangements&mdash;will you not?"</p>

<p>There was no coquetry, no affectation about her; the light
deepened on her noble face, her lips quivered, and then she told
him:</p>

<p>"Yes, whenever you wish."</p>

<p>They conversed that evening until the sun had set. He told
her all his experience since he had left her, and she found that
he had passed through London without even waiting to see
Lady St. Lawrence, so great had been his longing to see her.</p>

<p>But the next day Lady St. Lawrence came down, and by Sir
Vane's wish preparations for the marriage were begun at once.
Pauline preferred to be married at Audleigh Royal and among
her own people.</p>

<p>They tell now of that glorious wedding&mdash;of the sun that
seemed to shine more brightly than it had ever shone before&mdash;of
the rejoicings and festivities such as might have attended the
bridal of an empress&mdash;of the tears and blessings of the poor&mdash;of
the good wishes that would have made earth Heaven had
they been realized. There never was such a wedding before.</p>

<p>Every other topic failed before the one that seemed inexhaustible&mdash;the
wonderful beauty of the bride. She was worthy
of the crown of orange-blossoms, and she wore them with a
grace all her own. Then, after the wedding, Sir Vane and
Pauline went to Omberleigh. That was the latter's fancy, and,
standing that evening where she had seen Vane first, she blessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
him and thanked him with grateful tears that he had redeemed
her by his great love.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There was a paragraph in a recent issue of the <i>Times</i> announcing
that Oswald St. Lawrence, second son of Sir Vane
and Lady St. Lawrence, had, by letters-patent, assumed the
name of Darrell. So that the old baronet's prayer is granted,
and the race of Darrell&mdash;honored and respected, beloved and
esteemed&mdash;is not to be without a representative.</p>
